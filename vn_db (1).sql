The company, owned by Chinese firm PDD Holdings, has denied the allegations, claiming that they are based on misinformation circulated online.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the lawsuit, Temu\'s app is designed to gain unrestricted access to users\' phone operating systems and override data privacy settings. This allows the company to collect and monetize users\' personal data without their consent. Is Temu safe? The answer is unclear, as the company\'s practices have raised serious concerns about user privacy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The suit also claims that Temu is led by former Chinese Communist Party officials, which raises concerns about national security risks. Is Temu safe? With allegations of malware and spyware, it\'s clear that users should exercise caution when using the app.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Temu\'s popularity has been fueled by its offer of free delivery and cut-price goods shipped directly from China. However, the company has faced scrutiny over whether forced labor is used in its supply chains. The US Congress has already raised concerns about Temu and its rival Shein, which is planning a London Stock Exchange listing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The lawsuit filed by Arkansas\'s Attorney General Tim Griffin alleges that Temu is not an online marketplace like Amazon or Walmart, but rather a data-theft business that uses its ecommerce platform as a means to an end. Griffin stated that Temu is \"functionally malware and spyware\" and that it is purposefully designed to access users\' phones without their knowledge or consent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the allegations, Temu has maintained its innocence, stating that the claims are \"totally unfounded\" and will vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit.

They use these platforms to recruit truck drivers, advertise their services, and boast about evading authorities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Recent cases in Arizona have highlighted the issue. In August, 22 people were indicted for recruiting truck drivers using Snapchat posts that showcased cash and glamorized illegal migrant smuggling by border smugglers. Many of these posts claimed that drivers could earn substantial sums of money without the risk of being arrested. The posts often featured images and videos of large amounts of cash, implying that the illegal activity was lucrative and relatively safe.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In another case, an Arizona man was sentenced to 71 months in prison for transporting hundreds of illegal immigrants. Investigators found Snapchat posts in which he gloated about cramming people into overcrowded vehicles in unsafe conditions, and how he used minors to facilitate certain smuggling operations by border smugglers. This further exacerbates the gravity of the situation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These social media posts not only facilitate illegal activities but also perpetuate a culture of recklessness and disregard for human life.

The lawsuits were filed on behalf of major record companies, including Sony Music Entertainment, UMG Recordings, Inc., and Warner Records, Inc., which hold the rights to the recordings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The cases cover a wide range of music genres, styles, and eras, with the RIAA stating that the unlicensed use of AI technology is on a \"massive scale.\" The organization\'s Chairman and CEO, Mitch Glazier, emphasized the importance of responsible AI development and collaboration with the music industry.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We can only succeed if developers are willing to work together with us,\" Glazier said. \"Unlicensed services like Suno and Udio that claim it\'s \'fair\' to copy an artist\'s life\'s work and exploit it for their own profit without consent or pay set back the promise of genuinely innovative AI for us all.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The lawsuits aim to stop Suno and Udio from continuing their unlicensed use of copyrighted sound recordings and to establish the importance of ethical and lawful development of generative AI systems.

The warning label, similar to those on tobacco products, aims to increase awareness and change behavior, according to Murthy. The surgeon general\'s warning comes as social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat have been accused of having a profoundly negative impact on children, including promoting negative body images, shortened attention spans, and vulnerability to online bullies and predators.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The concern is not unfounded. Young people are spending an average of four hours a day on social media, exposing them to a constant stream of curated content that can be detrimental to their mental health. The platforms\' algorithms are designed to be addictive, keeping users engaged for as long as possible by serving up increasingly provocative content. This can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some US states have already taken steps to address the issue, passing legislation aimed at protecting children from the harmful effects of social media. For example, New York state has banned social media companies from serving addictive algorithmic content to users under the age of 18 without parental consent. Florida has gone further, banning children under 14 from using social media altogether and requiring 14- and 15-year-olds to get parental consent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Murthy\'s call for warning labels on social media apps is a critical step in addressing this public health crisis. By placing clear warnings on these platforms, we can empower young people and their parents to make informed decisions about their use of social media. It is time for Congress to take action and pass legislation requiring these warning labels, ensuring that young people are protected from the harms of social media.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2024-06-08', '21:32:23', 'warning-labels-on-social-media', 'article/visionariesnetwork-warning-labels-needed.jpg', 'social media warning', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-warning-labels-needed.jpg', 6, 2024, 'social media, social media news, latest news, visonaries network', 'Warning Labels Needed for Social Media&#039;s Hidden Dangers', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Building on their initial success with 2D robots, the team applied their innovative approach to a 3D facial mold, paving the way for more lifelike and functional robots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Challenge of Adhesion</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While human skin-like tissue has been developed for humanoid robots, the challenge of attaching this skin to robotic parts has been a major hurdle. Traditional methods have struggled to provide a secure and natural attachment, making it difficult to achieve realistic expressions and interactions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Inspiration from Human Skin Ligaments</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Inspired by the way human skin ligaments attach the skin to muscles, the researchers proposed perforation-type anchors to overcome the adhesion challenge. These innovative anchors mimic the structure and function of human skin ligaments, allowing the living skin to integrate with the robotic surface. This secure attachment enables natural movements and expressions, making humanoid robots more lifelike and engaging.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Optimizing Anchor Density</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The study also explored the relationship between anchor size, arrangement, and anchoring strength. By tailoring anchor density to specific areas, researchers can optimize adhesion based on the function and interaction with the environment. For example, areas with frequent external contact would require a higher anchor density, while regions needing flexibility would have fewer anchors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Implications and Future Directions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This breakthrough has significant implications for humanoid robotics, enabling the creation of more lifelike and functional robots that can seamlessly interact with humans. The integration of human-like skin with robots not only improves their aesthetic appeal but also enhances their interaction capabilities, bringing us closer to a future where robots blend seamlessly into our daily lives.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With this innovative technology, researchers have overcome a major hurdle in humanoid development, paving the way for further advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence.

Such infections are among the leading causes of issues in healthcare. The research explains the limitations of conventional antibiotic coatings, which have enabled drug-resistant bacteria to thrive.

The new method increases the efficacy of the nanoparticles in fighting bacteria and remaining stable over the long term. Scientists have created surfaces that are highly efficient in fighting bacteria and safe for human tissue by regulating the quantity of AgNPs utilized and the rate of release.<br><br><strong>Successful History of Fighting Drug-Resistant Bacteria<br><br></strong>To verify the effectiveness of AgNP-coated biomaterials, the scientists conducted a number of tests for antibacterial and anti-biofilm properties. The tests revealed that an adequate number of silver nanoparticles on the surface were able to effectively prevent bacteria from adhering and developing biofilms, even drug-resistant bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli. This is a pioneering discovery that indicates AgNP-immobilized biomaterials can be highly effective in preventing infections associated with medical devices.<br><br><strong>Ensuring Biocompatibility and Safety<br><br></strong>In addition to antibacterial activity, the AgNP-coated surfaces were also comprehensively tested for biocompatibility. Interestingly, human fetal osteoblasts, bone growth cells, were shown to be viable on the surfaces, demonstrating that the materials are non-toxic to human tissue. Such a balance between antibacterial activity and cell viability is critical in the creation of safe, long-term medical devices.<br><br><strong>Changing Clinical Uses<br></strong><br>This research has various applications. Silver nanoparticle-coated material can be added to different medical devices, including catheters, implants, and surgical tools.

She was a key part of The Apopka Chief newspaper, where she managed subscriptions, ad bills, and legal notices. She also ran the family business Apopka Office Supply store. When her husband, John Ricketson, passed away in July 2024, she rallied even harder to serve women, ensuring the newspaper was still accessible to the community. She recently sold both The Apopka Chief and The Planter newspapers to Mainstreet Daily News, which is owned by MARC Media in Orlando, just last month.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At lunch, Ricketson\'s youngest son Jamey read her acceptance speech. He conveyed her message and sincere thank you:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>\"Mom wanted to say thank you to all of you. She penned it because none of us can say it, so I\'m doing my best,\"</em> Jamey Ricketson said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eileen showed gratitude for the blessings and support of the community. <em>\"My prayer is that you are able to continue making this community be all that God would have it be,\"</em> she said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Eileen is from Maryland. She and John Ricketson were married on March 20, 1964, at a military base. They later moved to Florida and had three sons&mdash;twins Jerry and Joey, born in 1969, and Jamey, born in 1971. John was the publisher of The Apopka Chief in 1982 and worked diligently for the paper to thrive, and Eileen assisted him.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Inspiring Speech by Laura Halfpenny</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Laura Halfpenny, senior director of soccer success for the U.S. Soccer Federation, provided a moving keynote address. She challenged nearly 100 attendees to think about their values and to focus on developing their skills for women\'s achievement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Halfpenny devised a game of <em>\"Rock, Paper, Scissors\"</em> to determine key characteristics of success. \"Rock\" stood for standing firm in belief and community, \"paper\" stood for being receptive to success and listening to other individuals, and <em>\"scissors\"</em> stood for releasing unnecessary items to focus on the essentials.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>\"It\'s not stubbornness. It\'s about believing in something,\" Halfpenny explained. \"Ask yourself, \'What do I need to defend?\'\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">She also discussed how important it is to prioritize and manage time effectively. <em>\"Think about time because time is limited. We can\'t get more of it,\"</em> she said to us. <em>\"Ask yourself, \'What can you give up today?\'\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Halfpenny has worked in effective positions in various soccer associations, including Georgia State Soccer Association and Orlando City Youth Soccer Club. She now directs strategic programs to expand the footprint of soccer across the U.S.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Celebrating Success</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Women Success luncheon was successful. It united people in the community to celebrate women\'s success, such as Eileen Ricketson. Individuals in the community were inspired by speakers such as Laura Halfpenny.

(53, '', 'The U.S. Healthcare System Is Failing, But Personalized Care Offers Hope', 'The U.S. Healthcare System Is Failing, But Personalized Care Offers Hope', 'healthcare and medical devices', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The United States healthcare system is massive in scale. It is the last among developed countries in healthcare performance, and many Americans have lower life expectancies and increased incidence of long-term health conditions. Even after spending $4.9 trillion on healthcare in 2023, or about $14,570 per person, the system doesn\'t work right for patients.<br><br>One of the problems is that ordinary healthcare is not individualized for what any one person requires. Standardized care plans, convoluted insurance, and inattentive doctors are applied in the system. Most individuals can\'t have access to the care they require at the time they require it. But one emerging model is doing just this and it is known as direct-to-patient (DTP) healthcare. The model unites healthcare providers with patients directly, rendering care faster, less expensive, and more personalized.<br><br><strong>A Better Way To Manage Healthcare</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Experts are of the opinion that DTP healthcare is the future. It possesses five major benefits that render healthcare more efficient for everyone.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>1. Preventative and Personalized Care:</strong> Conventional healthcare only treats an individual once they are sick. DTP models, however, aim to not become sick. The firms apply technology, artificial intelligence, and genetic testing to design health plans for patients that are tailored to their individual requirements. This implies individuals can receive care tailored to their individual health requirements and not a generic one. Personalized care enhances treatment outcomes and overall well-being.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>2. Transparent Fees and Affordability:</strong> The biggest problem with traditional healthcare is that the costs are not transparent. Most people receive medical bills with surprise fees. DTP Healthcare aims to cut that out by providing transparent prices. The patients are well aware of what they will be paying for their treatments and their medicines. Since these companies lack the middlemen in insurance, they can also provide lower prices, which makes healthcare more affordable. Transparent treatment plans cut down unnecessary expenses by prioritizing what every individual patient actually needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>3. Affordable and Convenient Care:</strong> It is difficult for most people to go visit a physician due to long waiting times, complex scheduling, and mobility challenges. DTP Healthcare breaks these barriers by leveraging telehealth services. Patients can talk to doctors, refill prescriptions, and track their health from their smartphones or computers. This increases the accessibility of healthcare, particularly to rural residents or people with hectic lifestyles. Convenient care enables patients to take ownership of their medical needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>4. Sensitive Health Issue Specialist Support:</strong> There are individuals who do not visit the doctor due to shame over their health problems. This includes mental health problems, weight loss, and sexual health. DTP healthcare offers a confidential and non-judgmental means through which individuals can access the care that they need. This increases access to healthcare for individuals who would otherwise not receive care. Specialist treatment in these areas ensures that patients receive personalized care that is attentive to their individual needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>5. Empowering Patients with Information and Decision:</strong> DTP healthcare empowers patients with more control of their health. These platforms enable individuals to view their own personal health information, thus enabling them to monitor how they are doing and decide on their care. With the use of digital tools such as health dashboards and apps, patients can take control of their health. Personalized care and real-time tracking enable patients to have more control of their conditions and better outcomes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span><strong>A System of Health That Works for Everyone</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The U.S. healthcare industry is plagued with issues, but DTP Healthcare is a shining star. Focused on individual care, transparent costs, convenient access to services, confidentiality, and empowering the patient, this system is transforming healthcare and making it more effective. The more individuals choose DTP healthcare, the brighter the future may be for all of medicine.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: \'Calibri\',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: \'Times New Roman\'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-IN; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></span></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-03-23', '21:41:38', 'u-s--healthcare-system-is-failing-but-personalized-care-offers-hope', 'article/visionariesnetwork-us-healthcare-system-failing.jpg', 'The U.S. Healthcare System Is Failing', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-us-healthcare-system-failing.jpg', 3, 2025, 'The U.S. Healthcare System, Personalized Care, healthcare, us healthcare, latest us news', 'The U.S. Healthcare System Is Failing, But Personalized Care Offers Hope', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

Earlier, teachers tracked how students were doing through tests, grades, and remarks. However, these were usually too labor-intensive to display the results or did not provide the full picture. Now, with data analysis, teachers are able to instantly view how students perform, which enables them to make more informed decisions and steer learning better. With the analysis of a lot of information, teachers are able to comprehend better how students act, how they learn, and how they develop.<br><br><strong>The use of data analytics in education</strong><br><br>Data analytics refers to the act of collecting and evaluating large data amounts in order to discover trends and patterns. It is changing how we monitor the performance of students in education. Unlike old means that rely on random tests, data analytics measures multiple facets of student engagement like attendance, student participation, turning in homework, and even socialization. It gives a true and better indication of how much a student has learned.<br><br>Data-analyzing teachers are better equipped to make more informed decisions for their students. By establishing strengths and weaknesses prior to instruction, teachers can modify their own instruction and support students before small issues become big issues. Data analysis facilitates learning to occur prior to problems rather than after and benefits teachers and students.<br><br><strong>Personalized Learning through Data Analysis</strong><br><br>One of the largest advantages of data analytics in education is that it has the potential to make learning individualized. Each student learns uniquely, at his or her own pace, and has varying difficulties. The old way of teaching does not address these variations, and thus some students will lag behind or become disinterested.<br><br>With data analysis, instructors are able to craft learning plans that can address the needs of every student. By tracking how students engage with learning material, instructors are able to identify where students are having trouble and change lesson plans if necessary. This adaptive technique allows students to receive support that they can use to excel in school.<br><br>For instance, if a student is falling behind in a particular subject, data analysis will catch the issue early. Teachers can then provide additional resources, tutoring, or special classes to enable the student to catch up. This particular method increases student motivation and academic success.<br><br><strong>Real-Time Information for Early Assistance<br></strong><br>The advantage of data analytics is that it can give you insights in an instant. Old ways of evaluating do not reveal issues early on, and so students suffer in silence without prompt intervention. Data analytics, however, tracks the progress of students at all times, and teachers can address problems the moment they occur.<br><br>Since teachers have instant access to performance, they immediately know which students require additional assistance. If a student suddenly misses school or is less focused, for instance, it may be a sign that they are struggling. Teachers can step in and assist before a problem arises when they move quickly. Smart learning ensures that early intervention eliminates gaps in learning and keeps the students ahead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Helping Teachers Work More Effectively with Actionable Data</strong><br><br>Data analysis benefits not only students but also teachers to perform their duties more efficiently. It provides teachers with valuable information so they can better allocate their time and resources. Instead of applying the same approach to all students, teachers can tailor lesson plans to meet each student\'s requirements.<br><br>For instance, teachers can identify students who are performing well, those who are failing, and those who are at risk of falling behind. With this, they can focus more on what every student requires, provide individual attention, and create programs where brighter students help others. This method of teaching makes all the students perform better in class and ensures that no one is left behind.<br><br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-03-25', '21:37:48', 'smart-learning-and-data-analytics', 'article/visionariesnetwork-smart-learning.jpg', 'Smart Learning and Data Analytics', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-smart-learning.jpg', 3, 2025, 'How Smart Learning, Data Analytics, Transforming Education, smart education, smart classes', 'Explore the transformative impact of smart learning and data analytics on modern education.

This is due to the United States\' intention to bar high-end computer chips, such as Nvidia chips, from being exported to China.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz said that Washington has asked Malaysia to monitor the export of high-end semiconductor components, including Nvidia\'s AI chips, for fear that they are being exported to China.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;The US is asking us to check every shipment coming to Malaysia when it involves Nvidia chips,\" Aziz was quoted in the paper.<em> \"They are asking us to ensure servers find the right data centers and not find their way on another ship unexpectedly.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The United States is probing whether Chinese AI company DeepSeek has been using US chips prohibited in its advanced AI models. DeepSeek became popular in January with an AI model that showed capabilities on par with the world\'s leading companies. Since then, worries have increased about whether the company has obtained prohibited US technology through indirect supply chains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Malaysia is investigating if local regulations were violated in the export of servers in a Singapore fraud case. Prosecutors in Singapore this month stated that the case concerns $390 million worth of transactions that can be traced to the illicit supply of US servers into Malaysia. Reports say the servers could have included sophisticated AI chips, which are subject to strict US export controls.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Singaporean media has linked the case to the potential sale of Nvidia\'s AI chips to DeepSeek, sparking concerns about compliance with US trade regulations. Nvidia has not yet made a statement on the issue.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Malaysia\'s Role in the Semiconductor Supply Chain</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Malaysia actively participates in the global semiconductor industry supply chain, particularly in chip backend processing such as packaging and testing. It is home to numerous plants belonging to the world\'s largest semiconductor firms and is an important transit hub for high-performance computing hardware.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The development of AI is reliant primarily on sophisticated computer chips, and hence their export is now a political issue between nations. The US has imposed rigorous export controls in order to prevent China from having access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology due to concerns that these chips will find their way into the military and AI projects that will chip away American dominance in the field.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Malaysia\'s position as a semiconductor hub necessitates that it weigh economic interests against compliance with international regulation. The country reaps enormous advantages from the semiconductor industry but is also increasingly under pressure to regulate its role in the supply chain. Computer chips are crucial to numerous firms operating in Malaysia for manufacturing purposes, and therefore regulatory choices become critical to these firms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Regulatory Challenges and Future Implications</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The new Malaysian semiconductor regulations could lead to more cautious screening of shipments, stricter examination of business transactions, and increased collaboration with US authorities. Players in the industry observe that businesses in the semiconductor sector would need to be more transparent and adhere to more stringent regulations to prevent illicit transfers of critical technology. This growth indicates that international semiconductor trade is becoming more and more complex.

Let\'s make it clear:<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>1. Unmatched Precision</strong><br><br><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>MRF polishing is used in industries where very accurate measurements, down to the nanometer level, are needed. Traditional polishing methods, like lapping or chemical polishing, typically cannot produce such a high polish. MRF, however, can polish surfaces with nearly zero defects, making the polish extremely accurate.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>2. Damage-Free Polishing<br></strong><br>One of the largest issues with the precision polishing of delicate materials such as optical lenses, glass, and high-performance semiconductors is avoiding surface stress or minute scratches. Since MRF polishing utilizes a fluid, it is material-removing softly without creating mechanical stress or shape distortion.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>3. Repeatability and Consistency</strong><br><br>Traditional polishing methods often involve manual adjustment, and that introduces variability from batch to batch. MRF polishing, however, is mechanized and under tight control. That means that any product that has been polished using MRF will be of the same high quality and consistency, and it is a good option for high-volume production in the high-tech sector.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>4. Versatility of Materials</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From glass and ceramics to composites and metals, MRF polishing is applicable to a wide range of materials.

The most recent project titled AMIGOS is using AI technologies to study traffic and mobility behaviors of individuals, making life more convenient in different European cities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Smart Cities in Action</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A good example of this transformation is Las Rozas, Spain. At the Las Matas train station, intelligent cameras based on AI, produced by the Austrian Institute of Technology, monitor traffic and pedestrians. The cameras are able to process a lot of data quickly, providing city planners with valuable information to redesign public spaces well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The EU\'s Cities Mission supports 112 European cities in becoming climate-neutral and smart by 2030. AMIGOS contributes to this mission by utilizing AI to study data for solving city issues and enhancing safety. In order to support these efforts, urban mobility solutions are being considered to simplify transportation and reduce traffic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Enhancing Safety and Mobility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Las Rozas faces a large challenge since its city design is complex, with highways, railway stations, and areas where pedestrians can walk all combined. AI surveillance systems assist in identifying hazardous spots where pedestrians tend to walk away from crosswalks. Through the use of real-time data and public feedback, city authorities are making significant safety upgrades, such as improved sidewalks, more visible road markings, and additional parking spots for bikes and e-scooters. These improvements assist in urban mobility solutions within the city, making it easier and safer for all.<br><br><strong>More European cities are employing AI</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other European cities are using AI in urban planning, as Las Rozas is. ELABORATOR, which is headed by Dr. Angelos Amditis of the National Technical University of Athens, is implementing intelligent cameras in cities like Copenhagen and Issy-les-Moulineaux to track traffic patterns and avoid accidents. Traffic signs in France that are AI-powered change real time to offer safer routes for cyclists and pedestrians.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span><strong>Next-generation AI-based urban solutions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The AMIGOS initiative collaborates with ten cities, such as Hamburg, Reykjavik, and Bologna, as well as five twin cities that wish to implement these technology solutions.

The inquiry will determine if these firms are evading previous FCC prohibitions and continuing to operate in the United States by private or unregulated means.<br><br>The FCC has ordered some Chinese firms, such as Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp., to cut or halt their business in the U.S. due to national security concerns. These firms are significant players in the telecommunication industry, providing network equipment and services to carriers globally. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr further stated that some of these firms are attempting to circumvent the regulations and carry on their business in the U.S. market.<br><br><strong>Scope of the Inquiry<br></strong>The FCC probe will focus on Huawei and ZTE and three other electronics manufacturers that make communications gear and associated products. The FCC is also investigating several Chinese telecom carriers, including China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. The carriers have faced increasing regulatory scrutiny over the years due to security concerns.<br><br>The Covered List was established by the FCC in 2022. It includes companies that manufacture and sell products and services that are a potential threat to national security. Any company that is on this list cannot sell any of its products in the U.S. Despite all these regulations, there are some indications that these companies are still active in the country in different forms.<br><br><strong>Previous Actions Taken Against Chinese Enterprises<br></strong>Regulatory measures against such companies have become increasingly frequent in recent times. In 2019, the FCC ordered China Mobile to shut down its phone operations in the U.S. China Telecom and China Unicom were ordered to do the same in 2021 and 2022, respectively. In December 2023, the U.S. Commerce Department ordered China Telecom\'s remaining operations, including its cloud service and peering systems, to be shut down. Peering refers to the technique of how internet carriers exchange data traffic, which is necessary to remain connected.<br><br><strong>Objectives of the Probe<br></strong>The FCC probe is to determine whether these Chinese firms are still operating in the U.S. in violation of prohibitions against them. Authorities will also verify whether other firms are assisting them to remain. The agency has already issued several question letters and at least one subpoena to gather information.<br><br>This investigation is being carried out under the leadership of the FCC\'s Council on National Security. The council exists to oversee national security threats in the telecom sector. They are composed of eight members from various bureaus and offices of the FCC.

During his recent tour to inspect government residences in the Government Reservation Area (GRA) in Abeokuta, the governor observed the development in the building of new homes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Building Houses in Major Cities<br></strong><br>The governor averred that his government\'s housing estates in strategic locations such as Kobape, Iperu, Ijebu Ode, and Ilaro have beautified the state beyond measure, transforming the places into urban, well-planned cities. He added that the vision of Ogun State urban renewal is taking shape as his administration works towards the development of infrastructure.<br><br><strong>Ibara GRA Project and Urban Development</strong><br><br>Governor Abiodun stated that the initial batch of 35 houses in Ibara GRA, Abeokuta, is complete. He lamented the state of how poorly the GRAs previously were, making them undesirable to live in. To this his administration began work to upgrade the city, starting with a three-hectare land development in Abeokuta.<br><br>\"These houses were constructed by our workers, and they created employment for the people around here. The houses are good and yet within reach,\" Abiodun added. \"This project reveals a new face of Abeokuta and demonstrates that we are determined to improve living conditions.\"<br><br><strong>Construction and Community Participation</strong><br><br>Governor Abiodun was satisfied with the development of the project. He said quality infrastructure, such as drainage facilities, sidewalks, solar streetlights, electricity, and water pipes, have been installed. He further mentioned that the houses were constructed by local workers and not foreign contractors, i.e., bricklayers, painters, carpenters, and welders are assisting in the development of the state.<br><br>He appreciated the Commissioner for Housing and his staff for performing a wonderful job in executing the government\'s plans. He stated, \"If you have a vision and no great team to execute it, it is still a dream.

Blockchain protocol 2025 will transform industries with better scalability, security, and interoperability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over time, many protocols have been developed, each trying to address major issues like scalability, security, and decentralization. With 2025 around the corner, the blockchain world is more active than ever, with new protocols breaking the limits of what is possible in decentralized finance (DeFi), business solutions, and more. While many protocols promise to be the next big thing, few of them are <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../\">innovative</a></span> and can make a mark in the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Here\'s our take on the top blockchain protocols to watch in 2025:<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>1. Ethereum 2.0: The Dominant Force</strong><br><br>Ethereum has long been the choice for smart contracts and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/architecture-of-a-dapp/\">decentralized applications (dApps).</a></span> The shift to Ethereum 2.0 will be finished by 2025, and this will have the network much better at handling more transactions. Some of its critics have said that it has taken too long for Ethereum to sort out its scalability issues, but we think that its strong community of developers and early-mover advantage will keep it at the forefront. Ethereum 2.0 brings sharding and proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols, which lower energy consumption and increase transaction speed. This upgrade keeps Ethereum a strong player in the blockchain market, helping with DeFi, NFTs, and business applications.<br><br><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span><strong>2. Solana: The Speed King<br></strong><br>Solana is well-liked because of its fast transactions and low fees. Although the network goes down occasionally, attempts are being made to make it stronger. Some people say that the centralization of Solana is not good, but to us, its efficiency is a huge plus point for specific use cases like gaming and fast DeFi trading. Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), which makes it ideal for gaming, DeFi, and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/8-top-Web-30-use-cases-and-examples\">Web3 use cases</a></span>. As more stability and security enhancements are added, Solana is set to be one of the leading blockchain protocols to look out for in 2025.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>3. Polkadot: Interoperability Champion</strong><br><br>Polkadot has a unique multi-chain configuration that allows various blockchains to communicate and exchange information easily. This collaboration is crucial to the future of decentralized apps because it breaks down barriers and enhances network relationships. Polkadot is described as complicated by some, which makes it difficult for new developers to use, but I believe its long-term benefits outweigh the learning curve. Polkadot parachains provide tailored blockchain solutions and it is favored by developers who wish to create scalable and interoperable dApps. The Polkadot ecosystem will be robust, and adoption will extend to various industries by 2025.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>4. Avalanche: The Scalability Contender</strong><br><br>Avalanche has become a real threat to Ethereum, with quick transactions and lower fees. Its innovative method of agreement, known as Avalanche Consensus, enables fast confirmation of transactions. Although Avalanche has come a long way, some are worried that it has not received enough developer attention to be a real threat to Ethereum. Nevertheless, we think its innovative approach makes it stand out. The subnets of the platform enable developers to create customized blockchain networks for various uses. The more individuals begin to use it and the more projects are developed on Avalanche, the longer it will remain a viable option among blockchain systems in 2025.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>5. Cardano: The Research-Oriented Blockchain</strong><br><br>Cardano is cautious and science-based in its approach to developing blockchain. While others bemoan it being slow, the network is dedicated to being secure, expandable, and sustainable. Some think Cardano is too conservative, but we at Visionaries Network like that it is sticking to a peer-reviewed and science-based approach. With the introduction of smart contract capability, Cardano will be able to grow its ecosystem quite a bit by 2025. Its focus on peer review means that the protocol is secure and resilient, which is important for its position in the world of blockchain.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>6. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains<br></strong><br>Cosmos will tackle blockchain fragmentation by enabling different networks to seamlessly talk to each other. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol enables different blockchains to communicate with each other. It\'s been argued that Cosmos has garnered less hype than other protocols, but we believe its emphasis on collaboration puts it in the top underappreciated projects in the market. As projects begin to utilize IBC, Cosmos will be a key component in constructing a more cohesive and efficient blockchain system. In 2025, expect Cosmos to lead the charge on cross-chain transactions and interoperability.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>7. Near Protocol: The Simple-to-Use Blockchain<br></strong><br>Near Protocol is becoming popular because it is easy to use for developers and has a strong system. Its sharding mechanism is one of a kind and can handle a large number of transactions without compromising decentralization. Some are of the view that Near has fewer users than Ethereum or Solana, but we think that its focus on ease of use will see it compete favorably in the future. The ease of access of the protocol makes it perfect for both developers and businesses. Near Protocol will easily lead the adoption of blockchain by 2025, courtesy of its simplicity and efficiency.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>8. Algorand: The Green Blockchain</strong><br><br>Sustainability is key to harnessing blockchain, and Algorand is a leader in its carbon-negative blockchain. Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) system, which secures transactions and makes them efficient while causing the least possible harm to the environment. Some wonder if sustainability can scale blockchain to popularity, but we believe Algorand\'s focus on sustainable blockchain solutions is a notable strength. Its expanding portfolio of DeFi and business use cases makes it one of the most promising blockchain protocols in 2025.<br><br><strong><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>The Future of Blockchain Protocol 2025<br></strong><br>With technology advancing on the blockchain side, new protocols will continue to emerge, each addressing specific problems and use cases. The top blockchain protocol 2025 will be scalable, secure, and interoperable with a strong developer and user community.<br><br>Blockchain protocol 2025 will have more defined rules, improved mechanisms for processing more transactions such as sharding and layer-2 networks, and tighter integration with legacy financial systems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some of you may feel that adoption has slowed down, but we are of the opinion that 2025 is the year that significant improvements will see widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The blockchain protocols are evolving at a rapid rate, and to stay updated, you must watch the best protocols for 2025. Ethereum 2.0, Solana, Polkadot, Avalanche, Cardano, Cosmos, Near Protocol, and Algorand are some of the best blockchain protocols to watch in 2025. As the industry grows, these protocols will facilitate innovations, boost efficiency, and drive a decentralized future. As an investor, developer, or enthusiast, it is essential to learn blockchain protocols in 2025 to achieve the next leap in technology advancements.<br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-03-26', '11:02:18', 'top-blockchain-protocols-to-watch-in-2025', 'article/visionariesnetwork-top-blockchain-protocols.jpg', 'Top Blockchain Protocols to Watch in 2025', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-top-blockchain-protocols.jpg', 3, 2025, 'top blockchain protocols, blockchain 2025, blockchain trends, decentralized networks, blockchain innovations, blockchain technology, future of blockchain, digital transactions, emerging blockchain protocols', 'Discover the top blockchain protocols to watch in 2025.

This is a giant leap for the cryptocurrency sector. Now, institutional investors as well as day traders can invest in digital currencies without owning cryptocurrencies directly. Apart from that, experts think that this could increase interest in blockchain stocks since companies that are involved in blockchain technology might get more investment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Crypto ETFs Matter</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crypto ETFs allow one to buy shares of funds that reflect the value of cryptocurrencies like <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/top-blockchain-protocols-to-watch-in-2025\">Ethereum</a></span> and Bitcoin. Instead of accessing digital wallets and private keys, investors just sell these funds through conventional stock markets. This opens up the area of crypto investment for investors lacking in-depth awareness of blockchain systems.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Wall Street\'s Giant Leap into Crypto</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since these ETFs have been approved, big financial institutions are eager to offer investment tools based on cryptocurrency. Companies like Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock have been applying for permission for years. With the approval of the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/\">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a></span>, Wall Street is investing most heavily in blockchain technology to date.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s a watershed moment for the crypto market,\" said John Peterson, senior analyst at a leading investment company. <em>\"Crypto ETFs bridge traditional finance and digital currencies and make it easier for big investors to enter the market.\".</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How Will This Impact the Crypto Market?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The approval of crypto ETFs will generate a huge demand for virtual currencies. As more and more investors jump on the bandwagon, the value of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other virtual currencies can increase substantially.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Also, the greenlight signals regulators becoming more welcoming towards crypto adoption. This could usher in further blockchain technology innovations and encourage companies to dive into crypto-related services. Investors are keeping an eye on blockchain stocks too, as companies working on blockchain development will benefit from growing interest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Advantages of Crypto ETFs</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Investors see a few advantages in crypto ETFs:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Simple Access: No need to install digital wallets or handle private keys.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Regulated Investment: Crypto ETFs are governed by financial regulations, which reduces risks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Institutional Interest: Wall Street\'s support for crypto ETFs makes the industry more respectable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Diversification: Investors can add crypto ETFs to their portfolios without fully investing in digital currencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Problems and Risks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While euphoria exists, risks also exist with crypto ETFs. The volatility of prices of cryptocurrencies is a worry, with prices fluctuating wildly. Uncertainty of regulations elsewhere can also affect global adoption.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Analysts believe that with the expansion of the market, crypto ETFs will be a safe means of investing in cryptocurrencies. Blockchain stocks are being considered by investors as an alternative means of investing in the field.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next for Crypto ETFs</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the first batch of crypto ETFs now cleared, others are anticipating more financial products to come. Already, some companies are developing Ethereum-based ETFs and other blockchain-focused funds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Investors are watching closely to see how these ETFs will do in the next few months. If they become a hit, it might get more people to utilize cryptocurrencies and more blockchain stocks as more mainstream companies begin to utilize blockchain technology in their operations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Last Ideas</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The embrace of crypto ETFs is a watershed moment for Wall Street and the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/\">crypto universe</a></span>.

The achievement is a potential shift in the financial industry, opening the door for other fintech firms to attempt to find a place in the banking world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/\">The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</a></span> and the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.occ.treas.gov/\">Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)</a></span> have authorized SmartBiz to purchase Centrust Bank NA, located in Northbrook, Illinois. The fintech company made the announcement in a press release on Monday, the first time a fintech has become a bank since 2021.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Fintech Banking Move</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The road to becoming a full-fledged bank from Fintech is a long and arduous one, with significant regulatory hurdles. No fintech companies received such authorizations during the Joe Biden presidency, so SmartBiz\'s achievement is particularly significant. Fewer than a dozen firms, including LendingClub Corp. and SoFi Technologies Inc., have received banking charters in recent times.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Becoming a bank gives fintech firms such as SmartBiz access to lower-cost capital from insured deposits. It also gives them better relationships with regulators, ensuring they remain stable and compliant. This shift can incentivize more fintech firms to become banks in the rising Fintech Bank industry.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SmartBiz CEO Evan Singer cited the mission of the company to assist small businesses, an area that often is not well-serviced by conventional banks. \"The reason we\'re doing this is ultimately to serve small businesses really well that aren\'t being well-served today by banks around the country,\" Singer said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Regulatory Perspectives and Industry Influence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney Hood saw the significance of this approval. He stated that a \"safe, sound, and fair <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../magazine/profile/remedy-payment-solutions-aims-to-offer-transparent-pricing-and-personalized-service\">fintech</a></span> business model has a place in today\'s federal banking system.\" However, a Federal Reserve representative did not wish to comment on this.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SmartBiz gained popularity for helping small businesses secure loans during the pandemic because many people needed them. The US Chamber of Commerce reported that 5.4 million new business applications were submitted in 2021, showing the need for easy financial help.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The artist said that the process of becoming a bank started three years ago. There was a formal application submitted to the OCC in October 2023, and another was submitted to the Federal Reserve in February 2024. The company hired industry veterans like Tim Bogan and Joe Schenone, who both played important roles in LendingClub\'s bank acquisition, to help with the process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next for Fintech Banking</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Industry observers say SmartBiz\'s success could be the beginning of a bigger trend. Michele Alt, a partner with Klaros Group and someone who worked with SmartBiz, believes the approval process in the Trump administration could become more lenient for other fintech firms. \"Four years of regulators raising barriers, the barriers are being removed again,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With fintech companies always coming up with new ideas, the success of SmartBiz would inspire even more companies to get banking licenses, transforming financial services. Given that regulations continually change, the Fintech Bank hybrid concept would be an important aspect to the business industry in the upcoming years. Approval of SmartBiz as a Fintech Bank is an important step that may impact future choices when it comes to regulations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-03-28', '20:15:17', 'smartbiz-becomes-first-fintech-bank-approved-under-trump', 'article/visionariesnetwork-smartbiz-fintech-bank-trump.jpg', 'SmartBiz Becomes First Fintech Bank Approved Under Trump', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-smartbiz-fintech-bank-trump.jpg', 3, 2025, 'SmartBiz fintech, Trump administration approval, fintech bank, digital banking, fintech industry, first fintech bank approved, SmartBiz bank, financial technology, digital finance, fintech regulation', 'SmartBiz has made history as the first fintech bank to be approved under the Trump administration.

They are hopeful about the Trump administration\'s proposal to modernize the military. The President and Chief Strategy Officer of Anduril Industries, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-brose-50b026ab/\">Christian Brose</a></span>, believes the company\'s emphasis on low-cost and self-funded defense systems aligns with the agenda of the new administration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Referring to the Australian International Airshow, Brose stated that Anduril Industries is in a good position to capitalize on policy changes. \"The potential is huge, and clearly there\'s a great deal of interest on the part of the new Trump administration to do things differently,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Anduril\'s Ties to the Trump Administration</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anduril was established by Palmer Luckey, a tech <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../magazine/10-business-leaders-to-watch-2022\">entrepreneur</a></span> who resigned from Facebook after he supported Donald Trump. Luckey openly supported new defense technology and has contributed to Trump campaigns. \"We have connections to the current administration. It\'s no secret our founder has contributed to Trump and supported him for years,\" Brose stated. \"On a general level, it\'s good.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Trump administration has demonstrated a shift in defense appropriations by ordering the Pentagon to identify $50 billion in savings. But Brose believes that this reduction is not only to save money; it\'s also to invest in new military technology. \"It\'s not even necessarily the case that the reported 8% cut is really about cutting the defense budget or about shifting funds to other types of military technology,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Structured expansion and growth of AI within Anduril</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anduril is expanding rapidly. They are constructing a new factory in Ohio to manufacture autonomous systems. The firm is also considering manufacturing locations outside of the United States, such as Australia, if it is sound business to do so.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s also developing Ghost Shark with the Australian Defence Force, a next-generation autonomous underwater vehicle. Anduril Australia CEO David Goodrich even hinted at imminent announcements regarding mass production. Anduril is also partnering with OpenAI to introduce advanced AI to national security operations, affirming its title as a defence tech pioneer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future of Autonomous Military Systems</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Australia will be paying more than A$360 billion for U.S.-built nuclear-powered submarines in the AUKUS deal with the United States and Britain. Brose also has space for manned and unmanned defense gear. \"The benefit of unmanned systems such as Ghost Shark is that they can reach the target much sooner, and you can produce them in greater quantities and at lower cost,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With shifting priorities in international defense, Anduril is increasing its AI warfare tech investments, counting on the Trump administration\'s emphasis on innovation to fuel industry growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anduril Industries is closely aligned with the Trump administration and focuses on cutting-edge defense technologies, and it is to its advantage to grow. Since the American government is revolutionizing how it spends on the military and buys equipment, the company\'s focus on using robots in combat and incorporating AI puts it at the vanguard of the defense industry.

A number of detentions and strict travel policies have made international guests question how they are treated. If these tough measures continue, the effect could be considerable&mdash;not just on travelers but on the US economy as well. Some individuals are now looking for easy travel options to avoid future problems at the border.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Economic Implications of US Tourism</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.cyberoptik.net/\">Tourism</a></span> to the USA has always been widely attractive, with overseas visitors spending more than $100 billion on holidays in 2023. Educational tourism also earned the same amount of around $50 billion, and corporate travel contributed another $23 billion. If overseas visitors are fewer in number, then it could be a major issue for many industries, such as airlines, hotels, and tourism. But the fear of entry restrictions is encouraging many tourists to explore other, easy travel destinations instead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Current trends indicate that foreign travelers, particularly Europeans and Canadians, are reconsidering trips. Trump\'s immigration disputes, unstable foreign relations, and concerns regarding US air travel security have already posted a definite decline in visits. Foreign visitors fell 2.4% short of last year in February 2024, as reported by the National Travel and Tourism Office. Another 5% decline in 2025 is forecasted by the firm <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.tourismeconomics.com/\">Tourism Economics</a></span>, which might be a conservative forecast if things persist. Tourists seeking easy travel experiences might now opt for destinations with more relaxed entry regulations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Detentions and enhanced entry restrictions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US government has also stepped up the enforcement of immigration laws, and foreign visitors have been arrested under ambiguous reasons. A recent instance was that of a German citizen, Lucas Sielaff, who was arrested for two weeks due to a misinterpretation of his visa status. This has prompted Germany\'s foreign office to warn visitors that even those with valid visas or ESTA waivers are not guaranteed to be admitted.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The UK has also changed its travel advisory, warning that visitors may be held if they do not adhere to the entry rules strictly. The experience of Welsh visitor Becky Burke, who was held for 19 days and allegedly transferred in chains, has raised further alarm. While US authorities assert their actions are legal, the perception of the events has raised further international alarm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">France has protested the grounds on which the US government rejected entry for a French scientist to attend a conference in Houston. The US cited breaches of a non-disclosure agreement on confidential information on an electronic device, but the scientific community and French authorities are skeptical. The move has sent shockwaves among scholars and professionals intending to travel to the US.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Other Travel Obstacles</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Trump administration\'s gender identity approach came as a shock to individuals in European nations. Individuals whose passports identify them as \"X\" gender rather than male or female might face difficulty at the border since the administration does not regard non-binary gender expressions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, safety concerns related to US air travel, mass shootings, and strict immigration policy are making prospective visitors think twice. For Canadian tourists, the return rate from the US by car dropped 23% and by air dropped 13% in February. European tourists are also experiencing a similar decline.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Potential Economic Impacts of US Travel Policy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Domestic tourism remains healthy, but dwindling foreign travelers are beginning to affect foreign-tourist-dependent enterprises. Foreign exchange-dependent hotels, airlines, and tourist sites may soon be facing financial difficulties. A depreciating US dollar may make it cheaper to take a vacation in America but difficult to repair damage to the country\'s international image.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The impending 2026 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico, will test America\'s capacity to receive international guests. While enthusiastic sports fans might ignore the political animosity between countries, mainstream tourists might prefer other hosts where they feel safer and appreciated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Reflections</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you intend to travel to the US, be very careful. Get all your documents ready, be clear about your intentions when speaking with border officials, and do not carry personal information on your devices. As regulations are changing and enforcement is becoming stricter, overstaying or giving incomplete information can have serious repercussions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ultimately, the US government\'s approach to border control and foreign affairs will determine whether the country remains a top choice around the globe. If present trends hold true, America can expect to lose not just tourists but billions in economic dividends and valuable international goodwill as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Excellent Travel Tips</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To prevent unnecessary inconvenience, always consult the latest US visa policies and travel restrictions prior to planning your trip. Staying updated with easy travel guides can assist international travelers in streamlining US entry procedures.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most of the visitors today are looking for easy travel plans that facilitate their journeys. Awareness of border protocols and proper documents in hand will guarantee faster processing. When you are going on a vacation or a business trip, keeping travel simple can make your trip simpler and more enjoyable for you.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-03-29', '11:01:40', 'is-easy-travel-still-possible-for-foreign-tourists-in-president-donald-trumps-america', 'article/visionariesnetwork-foreign-tourists-president-donald-trump-america.jpg', 'Travel  Foreign Tourists in President Donald Trump&rsquo;s America', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-foreign-tourists-president-donald-trump-america.jpg', 3, 2025, 'easy travel, foreign tourists, Trump administration, travel restrictions, U.S. travel policies, tourism under Trump, America travel ban, U.S. immigration policy, international tourists, Trump era travel', 'Explore how President Donald Trump&#039;s policies have impacted foreign tourists&#039; ability to travel easily to the U.S. Discover the challenges and changes in travel restrictions, visa regulations, and immigration during his presidency.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

AI is where the big tech firms battle it out, and Microsoft has invested a lot of money in this. Its partnership with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, has established it as a top firm in generative AI. Microsoft has integrated AI into its Bing search engine, Microsoft 365 software package, and Azure cloud infrastructure. However, Microsoft is behind AWS and Google in AI infrastructure largely because of its reliance on third-party chips and models.<br><br><strong>Gaming, Social Media, and Search</strong><br><br>Microsoft is not only dominant in AI and cloud computing. It is expanding into gaming, search, and social media. With the purchase of Activision Blizzard, it entrenched itself in the gaming space, with Xbox and Game Pass becoming increasingly popular. LinkedIn, purchased in 2016, continues to expand but is not yet as dominant as platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or X (formerly Twitter).<br><br>Microsoft introduced the Bing search engine in 2009, but it has failed to pose a challenge to Google. Despite the advancement in AI, Bing remains way behind in the search engine market. Similarly, Microsoft\'s foray into mobile computing and AI assistants has not been as fruitful as Apple\'s and Google\'s.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Challenges and Opportunities</strong><br><br>One of the biggest problems of Microsoft is that it does not have its own AI chips.

As per the post, a UK startup is developing a QWERTY smartphone based on the iconic BlackBerry Classic. The user was under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) but posted important details that got BlackBerry enthusiasts abuzz.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The new phone will feature 5G connectivity, an AMOLED screen, a capacitive QWERTY keyboard, and the Android 15 operating system. The phone will also feature 12GB of RAM and storage options of 256GB or 512 GB. Most importantly, the phone will feature generative AI, which makes it stand out from other smartphones in the market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>BlackBerry\'s patents and better design</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The UK-based startup is in talks with Malikie Innovations to obtain the exclusive rights to BlackBerry\'s patents. It suggests they have something to do with the old QWERTY phone heritage. The firm plans to create several devices with QWERTY keyboards, including a possible slider device, according to the user. An AI-generated image that appeared on the subreddit included the words \"BlackBerry Patents,\" \"QWERTY,\" and \"The world\'s first,\" but the details were left vague.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The camera hardware is reported to feature a 50MP Sony sensor, a significant upgrade for a phone of this type. The firm is also going to make use of quality materials in its construction, so the phone should feel high-end. Although the initial prototype is reported to employ a MediaTek processor, negotiations are underway to possibly switch to a Snapdragon chipset. What security-minded users will appreciate is that the phone is set to have a custom Android ROM, with data security and user privacy being the priority.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Funding and Market Challenges</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/anduril-industries-sees-opportunity-as-trump-administration-reshapes-defense\"> startup</a></span> appears to have a great strategy, including patents, manufacturing partners, and a prototype video rumored to be a customized BlackBerry Key2. Its success, though, will depend on securing sufficient funds. As u/coldheartedsigma reports, the entrepreneur has already received offers of between &pound;15 million and &pound;20 million for only a 5% stake. Some investors are even considering purchasing the entire firm due to its robust supply chain, valuable concepts, and future strategies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the positive news, the future of the project is uncertain. The user went on to add, \"If they receive their required money, it appears that they are ready to sell it.\" The devices must undergo rigorous testing, such as FCC, CE, and UKCA. Official public statements have yet to be released, however.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A BlackBerry Rebirth or New Beginning?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The news has BlackBerry enthusiasts thrilled, but others are also not so certain. The user is anonymous; there are no confirmations and no branding, so others are questioning whether they are genuine claims. In addition, the user clarified that it\'s not a return of BlackBerry directly because the brand has exited the smartphone market. The project, however, is committed to offering a quality QWERTY smartphone experience based on licensed BlackBerry technology but under a new brand name.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If the startup gets the investment it is seeking, it could revive a high-end QWERTY smartphone, and it would be a serious threat to players such as Unihertz.

In a recent crackdown, the state government closed down 23 Goa beach shacks for violating the Shack Policy 2023-2026 on grounds of illegal subletting and other operational malpractices. This is a part of a larger effort to establish order and equity in the industry, which is a quintessential aspect of Goa\'s tourism identity.<br><br><strong>The allure of Goa\'s Beach Shacks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Goa\'s beach shacks are distinct in that they are modest and rooted in the natural beauty of the area. They are usually made of natural materials like bamboo, wood, and palm fronds. The shacks offer tourists a true coastal experience that is both vintage and modern. To most of the locals, the shacks are an important source of income during the peak tourist season that lasts from September to May. They are allowed to operate through a lottery system that is meant to benefit Goan residents who are unemployed.<br><br><strong>Issues Encountered During Recent Inspections</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Goa <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2024/08/costco-travel-deals\">Tourism</a></span> Department recently carried out inspections at several establishments and discovered many rule-breaking activities. One of the biggest issues is that some shacks are being illegally rented out to non-Goans who have no familial connection to the original license holder. In a few instances, operators were discovered running on deck beds without a license and proper GST registrations. Further, instances were discovered where sales systems were registered in the name of individuals who are not registered as license holders. These activities have raised concerns over exploiting the system, and the government has moved swiftly.<br><br><strong>Government Crackdown and Enforcement Actions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As a response to such violations, the government has canceled the licenses of defaulting operators, imposed hefty fines, and ordered the demolition of unauthorized structures in 15 days. Shutting down such 23 Goa beach shacks has been seen as a measure to restore the integrity of the beach shack business so it can remain a site of genuine local entrepreneurship and not a means of outside exploitation.<br><br><strong>Violent attacks provoke instantaneous reaction</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The crackdown follows a string of violent skirmishes at beach shacks. In January, a deadly brawl at a shack in Arambol over the placement of benches demonstrated the licensee\'s illegal subletting of the shack to non-Goans. A second deadly accident in December in Calangute killed an Andhra Pradesh tourist after a fight with shack operators. Such accidents demonstrate the need for tighter controls and monitoring in the Goa beach shacks sector to ensure the safety of individuals and the security of Goa\'s tourism industry.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Influence on Goa Tourism Partners</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the tourism stakeholders in Goa, the government\'s action has challenges and opportunities. While, on the one hand, the closure of illegal shacks temporarily affects business for the legitimate operators, on the other, the action signals the government\'s resolve to ensure that the Goa beach shack industry remains true to its nature&mdash;serving local communities and offering real experiences to tourists. By closing down illegal operations, the government aims to prevent exploitation and ensure that the shacks remain a part of Goa\'s economic and cultural life.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Balancing Tradition and Modern Tourism </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Goa is becoming a popular travel spot, so the rules for its beach shacks are very important. It will be necessary to keep the old charm of the beach shacks while also meeting the needs of modern tourists to keep Goa attractive for visitors. By dealing with rule-breaking and protecting local businesses, the government wants to make sure that Goa\'s beach shacks stay a symbol of the state\'s beauty for many years.<br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-04-02', '22:07:07', 'goa-beach-shacks-under-crackdown-to-preserve-local-charm', 'article/visionariesnetwork-goa-beach.jpg', 'Goa Beach Shacks Under Crackdown to Preserve Local Charm', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-goa-beach.jpg', 4, 2025, 'Goa beach shacks, crackdown, local charm, tourism, beach shacks regulation, Goa tourism', 'Goa initiates a crackdown on beach shacks to preserve the region&#039;s local charm, aiming for sustainable tourism and better beach management.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

As individuals seek more natural solutions to artificial supplements, CBD Life Sciences is taking a shrewd step that may revolutionize the future of wellness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Brain-Boosting Mushrooms Backed by Science</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Research indicates that certain mushrooms, such as <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lions-mane-mushroom#dementia\">Lion\'s Mane</a></span> (Hericium erinaceus), are beneficial for the brain through nerve regrowth and memory. Researchers at the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.uq.edu.au/\">University of Queensland</a></span> discovered that some of the compounds in the mushrooms stimulated the growth of nerves and enhanced mental processes&mdash;bridging ancient medicinal knowledge and modern science.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CBD Life Sciences is implementing these findings into its R&amp;D for the development of new <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/glenmark-launches-vancomycin-hydrochloride-for-injection-usp\">health</a></span> products. They are designed to enhance cognitive ability, halt mental deterioration, and enhance overall mental clarity. They are produced by utilizing non-psychedelic, science-backed mushroom extracts, which offer safe and effective alternatives to conventional medicine.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Thriving Industry with Billions at Stake</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The global functional mushroom marketplace is expected to expand to $19.3 billion by the year 2030. Natural solutions for health, focus, and living life more are more and more desired by consumers. CBD Life Sciences is coming to market at the tipping point that enables the business to take advantage of a colossal opportunity much beyond wellness supplements.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mushrooms are also being studied in different fields, like green packaging, biodegradable materials, and even very sophisticated robots produced using mycelium-based technology. CBDL\'s entry into this field is not merely about selling mushroom capsules&mdash;it\'s about becoming part of a world of unlimited possibilities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Quality, Safety, and Consumer Confidence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With more focus being put on mushroom wellness, public safety comes first. CBD Life Sciences prioritizes the highest possible quality and regulatory compliance. While companies are selling unregulated psychedelic products, CBDL only utilizes lab-tested, non-psychoactive ingredients in their products.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This assurance of safety and transparency assists in building consumer confidence and solidifying the company\'s leadership as a wellness company.

(90, '', 'New Research Enhances CBD Absorption in the Body', 'New Research Breakthrough Significantly Improves CBD Absorption in the Body', 'cbd and wellness', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There may be a new scientific breakthrough that could revolutionize how the body absorbs cannabidiol (CBD). This can result in safer, more effective, and less expensive treatments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CBD is famously known to assist with pain, inflammation, and brain protection. It has been used to assist in treating conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain. Yet, one of the greatest issues that keep CBD from being effective is that it is poorly absorbed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CBD is not soluble in water, meaning that the body can\'t digest it when consumed orally. What that implies is that a significant amount of the CBD individuals consume doesn\'t find its way into the bloodstream in significant quantities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, researchers at the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.unisa.edu.au/\">University of South Australia (UniSA)</a></span> have solved this issue by significantly enhancing the bioavailability of CBD absorption using a phospholipid complex.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The new system employs a fat-based molecule that contains phosphorus to form minute particles known as a CBD-PLC (CBD-phospholipid complex). It facilitates the ease with which CBD dissolves within the body and enhances the amount that is absorbed and delivered where it is required.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The study found that these advanced particles helped CBD to dissolve from 0% to a whopping 67.1% in just three hours.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is a significant breakthrough for CBD-based therapies,\" said <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thabata-muta/?originalSubdomain=au\">Thabata Muta, lead author and UniSA PhD student</a></span>. \"Improved CBD absorption allows patients to achieve improved outcomes at lower doses, minimizing side effects and cost of treatment.\".</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The researchers also reported that there was an increase in permeability by 32.7% in tests on cells. This would allow more of the CBD to pass through the intestinal lining and into the bloodstream.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another advantage is that the formulation is stable for a longer duration. Unlike traditional CBD products that can degrade upon exposure to heat, light, or oxygen, the new phospholipid complex was stable even after 12 months of storage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This improvement benefits CBD users and could also provide a lead to better utilization of other insoluble medication.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The global CBD market is expected to grow from $7.59 billion in 2023 to over $200 billion by 2032. This discovery comes at the ideal time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/glenmark-launches-vancomycin-hydrochloride-for-injection-usp\">Pharmaceutical firms</a></span> have attempted to make CBD absorption easy with man-made equivalents, emulsions, or gel capsules &mdash; but they have side effects or act erratically. The UniSA researchers\' approach does not involve artificial additives and uses materials that are naturally compatible with the body membranes, and is therefore more comfortable and a safer option.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The scientists are preparing for clinical trials and searching for means of marketing this breakthrough. If it succeeds, this may lead to more effective and consistent CBD medications &mdash; particularly for individuals with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, anxiety, and pain.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In short, this new way of CBD absorption can now enable us to utilize all the medicinal value of cannabidiol to the fullest.

The company\'s first store, dedicated to its unique perfumes, opens this week in Pune on JM Road. This trendy address places RZLER on par with the biggest fashion and perfume brands&mdash;a great beginning for what is considered by many to be the best luxury perfume brand in Pune.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Pune store marks the beginning of ten more RZLER stores that will arrive in India, with planned openings in Mumbai, Delhi, and Bengaluru. They will be different experiential destinations, shaped with sophistication and an understated sense of luxury. RZLER\'s coming to India is not merely a <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../retail-and-ecommerce\">retail experience</a></span> but a strategic cultural gateway that integrates classic craftsmanship into modern chic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The brand name, RZLER (\"rizzler\"), is derived from a modern slang expression employed by Millennials and Gen Z to refer to someone who is effortlessly charismatic and cool. The allusion to youth culture, along with the luxury packaging of RZLER, makes the brand a new face of worldwide sophistication.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">RZLER also has its line of gender-neutral fragrances, which can be purchased online at www.perfume.rzler.com. RZLER is preparing to sell on India\'s top online shopping platforms, such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Nykaa. To provide customers with even more convenience, the company is going to partner with fast-delivery businesses such as Zepto, Blinkit, and Flipkart Minutes. This will enable more people to access the best luxury perfume brand in Pune and beyond.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the core of RZLER is its founder, Jason Averill, a successful American tech <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../magazine/20-business-experts-2023\">entrepreneur</a></span> and international traveler with a lifelong love of fashion and design. \"India\'s craft tradition is simply unparalleled,\" Averill said. \"What we\'re doing at RZLER is honoring that tradition in products that honor the past but look to the future. Our perfumes aren\'t fragrances&mdash;they\'re narratives, told in craftsmanship and elegance.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Averill\'s aspiration is not just about perfumes. RZLER will soon launch a whole lifestyle line of high-quality suits, fashion bags, first-class leather goods, and beautiful fashion clothes. Everything is a manifestation of the same quality consciousness that has already made RZLER the best luxury perfume brand in Pune.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">India is not just a market for Averill but also inspires him.

(94, '', 'Google Search Algorithm Updates: Key Insights for SEO Experts', 'Google Search Algorithm Updates: What SEO Experts Need to Know?', 'Voice', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let\'s be realistic: every time there is a Google Algorithm Update, the SEO community acts as if it\'s in a huge shock. Rankings are changed, traffic goes up or down, and online teams rush to figure out what happened. But instead of treating these updates as problems, we should see them for what they are: major changes.&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../\">At Visionaries Network</a></span>, we treat every Google Algorithm Update as a message&mdash;not a penalty, but a chance to improve.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We are at a place where searching no longer equals finding the appropriate information; it equals trust, as well. Google is demonstrating it increasingly with every iteration of its algorithm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why the Panic? The Update Isn\'t the Problem</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Each time there is a <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/8-major-google-algorithm-updates-explained-282627\">Google Algorithm Update</a></span>, individuals freak out on SEO forums, and client calls increase. But the reality is that most of these updates do not occur overnight. They are part of a long-term strategy to improve search and enable users to find good, useful content.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We\'ve all witnessed what happens when websites employ outdated tactics&mdash;keyword spamming, deceptive titles, or low-quality links. When Google Algorithm Update comes along, those websites vanish. And frankly? That is the way the system is meant to function.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We must stop considering algorithm changes to be assaults and start seeing them as messages. Google isn\'t trying to throw us into a tailspin. It\'s explaining to us, in blunt terms, the type of content that it needs. If we want to be found in a search, we must be willing to embrace that vision.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>EEAT and Demand for Real Power</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the major themes in the latest Google Algorithm Updates is EEAT: Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It is not only a trend but also the foundation on which Google\'s search system is evolving.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We have seen how websites that demonstrate genuine experience&mdash;through extensive analysis, case studies, or personal reviews&mdash;tend to do well after a Google Algorithm Update. On the other hand, websites that publish superficial content with no specific insights are gradually disappearing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We apply this thinking everywhere at Visionaries Network. We try to deliver actual value when we release blog posts, whitepapers, or videos. This means going out and finding experts, backing up statements with facts, and producing content that answers actual user questions&mdash;not what\'s trending in a keyword tool.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2025 SEO: Depth Over Hacks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We believe 2025 will be a pivotal year for the SEO field. Due to the updates in every Google Algorithm Update, we currently reside in an era in which tricks no longer apply.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What exists today is:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Quality-first content:</strong> Detailed, well-researched, and user-focused writing</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>UX-oriented design:</strong> Quick loading speed, mobile friendliness, and simplicity</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Transparency:</strong> Clear authorship, verified facts, and real-world experience</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Measuring performance and adjusting on evidence, not on projections</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is the kind of SEO we are proud to do&mdash;and, truthfully, the kind that should win. When Google releases a new Algorithm Update, we don\'t freak out. We review our work, modify our strategy, and look for opportunities to concentrate on what matters most: assisting users.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Let\'s Call a Spade a Spade: Lazy SEO Is the True Menace</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s not Google that\'s damaging your rankings; it\'s the shortcuts you took. When individuals blame a Google Algorithm Update for dropping traffic, they\'re usually sidestepping the issue. If your SEO strategy is not based on a strong foundation, it will tremble when things change.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The reality is that Google is not the bad guy. It\'s a compass. Each new update reorients that compass to point toward content that is valuable, relevant, and authoritative. We need to embrace that, not resist it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We at Visionaries Network fully endorse this shift. We believe that SEO professionals who concentrate on trust and value, rather than quick fixes, will not only survive upcoming Google Algorithm Updates but thrive in spite of them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts: Stop Chasing, Start Building</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We\'ve mentioned it before, and we have to mention it again: if your SEO plan is all about attempting to manipulate the next Google Algorithm Update, then you\'re playing the wrong game. The victors in this new reality will be those who plan long-term &mdash; those who create content that responds to actual questions, those who are concerned with good experiences, and those who view search visibility as a byproduct of quality, not as an end in itself.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, the next time Google Algorithm Update occurs, don\'t be in a hurry to correct things. Think. Go through your content. Improve your site. Ask yourself: Are we really serving the user? Because that\'s the sole strategy that stands the test of time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-04-07', '23:46:10', 'google-search-algorithm-updates-what-seo-experts-need-to-know', 'article/visionaries-network-google-search-algorithm-seo-expert.webp', 'Google Search Algorithm Updates: What SEO Experts Need to Know?', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-google-search-algorithm-seo-expert.webp', 4, 2025, 'Google updates, SEO experts, search algorithm, SEO trends, Google ranking, search engine optimization, algorithm changes, SEO strategies, digital marketing, visionaries network', 'Stay ahead with the latest Google search algorithm updates.

The investment has the potential to change the EV space. Slate Auto has been laboring in secrecy since its launch in 2022, based on a TechCrunch report. Slate Auto\'s goal is ambitious: to produce a small, two-seat electric pickup truck that will cost around $25,000.<br><br>This no-frills but high-tech EV is intended to democratize electric mobility&mdash;namely, for those priced out of current high-end electric vehicles. Slate Auto is going all in on the affordable electric pickup truck being a winner with urban commuters, small business owners, and price-sensitive consumers who desire functionality without luxury cost.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Backed by Big Investors</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Slate Auto is no tiny <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/uk-startup-developing-blackberry-inspired-qwerty-smartphone\">startup</a></span>.

Focusing on practical AI applications, Google announced everything from new AI chips to intelligent assistants and advanced models&mdash;all intended for business application in the real world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The most talked-about announcement was the launch of Ironwood TPU, Google\'s seventh-generation AI chip. Each Ironwood pod contains over 9,000 chips and delivers 42 exaflops of capacity&mdash;24 times the capacity of the world\'s most advanced supercomputers today. More importantly, the chips are power-efficient, consuming half the energy, which is one of the biggest challenges of AI computing: the consumption of energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The future with AI is as large as it is,\" said Amin Vahdat, Google\'s VP of ML systems and Cloud AI. \"With our new technology, we\'re in a golden age of AI innovation.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Google Cloud Next 2025, performance was not the only thing in the limelight&mdash;it was usability. Google announced a wide range of AI tools for business users, including enhanced generative media tools, smarter AI models, and no-code agent builders. These allow non-technical users to create powerful AI systems with minimal effort.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the key features was the refresh of the Gemini AI line.<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/\"> Gemini 2.5 Pro</a></span> is designed for complex domains such as finance and healthcare. It is capable of multi-step reasoning and in-depth analysis. Gemini 2.5 Flash is a more compact version that adapts to prompt complexity, delivering a good performance-cost balance. These are not merely big language models&mdash;they are \"thinking models.\" They can logically dissect issues, make judgments, and even think through their own outputs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Google is offering its 2-million-mile fiber network through Cloud WAN. This allows companies to tap into the same high-speed network that supports YouTube and Gmail. Google claims that Cloud WAN can enhance performance by as much as 40% and also lower network management expenses by a considerable amount.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To serve businesses even further, Google created a multi-agent system. With the new Agent Development Kit (ADK), developers can now create intelligent AI agents in fewer than 100 lines of code. Better yet, Google is encouraging Agent2Agent (A2A), a platform that allows AI agents from various businesses&mdash;e.g., Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow&mdash;to collaborate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This implies a transition to open, common AI rather than closed systems. That is, companies can access the best solutions of multiple providers without compatibility issues.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a demonstration, Google demonstrated how a manager of a bank account would be able to utilize Agent Space to review customer data, predict cash flow, and trigger targeted emails&mdash;all without writing a single line of code. All these capabilities make AI accessible to business teams, not engineers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Google is also applying AI to Workspace applications. \"Help me Analyze\" in Sheets discovers insights without the need for formulas. \"Audio Overviews\" in Docs transform documents into simple-to-follow summaries. These applications demonstrate that Google\'s 2025 AI updates are not merely for large tech firms&mdash;these are meant for day-to-day business tasks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Google Cloud Next 2025, Google promoted its end-to-end approach: it provides bespoke AI chips, multi-agent systems, generative media software, and model hosting&mdash;on the same platform. This puts it directly in competition with Microsoft and Amazon, which are more intensely focused on specific areas of AI. By creating all the way from the chip to the chatbot and supporting open standards, Google is making it simpler for firms to utilize strong AI without having to be locked into one vendor.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-04-09', '00:20:59', 'google-cloud-next-2025-unveils-smarter-ai-tools-and-chips', 'article/visionaries-network-google-cloud-2025-ai-tools-chips.webp', 'Google Cloud Next 2025 Unveils Smarter AI Tools and Chips', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-google-cloud-2025-ai-tools-chips.webp', 4, 2025, 'Google Cloud Next, AI tools, AI chips, Visionaries network, cloud computing, AI innovation, Google Cloud, machine learning, cloud AI, tech advancements, smarter AI', 'Google Cloud Next 2025 introduces smarter AI tools and chips, revolutionizing cloud computing and machine learning with cutting-edge technology and innovation.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

They attribute this to uncertainty regarding potential US tariffs on imports of semiconductors. Samsung Electronics price hike comes after the global financial markets reacted to heightened trade tensions as a result of US President Donald Trump\'s recent moves to slap <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/china-manufacturing-sector-faces-challenges-amid-trade-tensions\">tariffs</a></span>. They have the potential to disrupt semiconductor supply chains and dampen world economic growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Industry observers note that this move is a proper response to the threat of tariffs that could be imposed on some semiconductor products. If such tariffs are imposed, the extra cost to chipmakers and electronics firms could make memory chips even more expensive over the next few months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Samsung Electronics price hike to manage future risks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Analysts attribute Samsung Electronics price hike to coping with potential US trade restrictions. \"Companies are preparing for a tough second half of the year,\" said Kevin Liu, a semiconductor market analyst. \"This price increase is an indication of what the industry anticipates: increased operating expenses and reduced profits if tariffs are enforced.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The NAND flash memory and DRAM markets react strongly to changes in demand and supply. In recent times, companies like Samsung have reduced output to address oversupply. However, with trade risks being such a significant problem, this tight supply&mdash;along with defensive pricing maneuvers&mdash;may lead to even higher costs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Chip prices rise due to supply cuts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Memory chip manufacturing remains constrained as firms take a wait-and-see stance. Most manufacturers cut production during the 2024 downturn in demand and have not yet regained full capacity. Thus, analysts expect memory prices to rise further in Q3 and Q4 of 2025, particularly if US tariffs are ultimately implemented.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Samsung Electronics price hike will be experienced throughout prices in the technology sector. Smartphone, PC manufacturers, and data center companies that use DRAM and NAND flash chips will likely increase prices to consumers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Market reaction reflects broader concerns</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Investors and market analysts are reading the jump in Samsung Electronics\' price as an indicator of wider trade and supply chain fluctuation.

The 31-year-old entrepreneur was the youngest of seven industry leaders invited to the meeting, which featured leaders in logistics, shipping, and high-end manufacturing. His presence indicates that the nation is acknowledging the increasing role of humanoid robots and AI innovation.<br><br>Born in 1993, Peng Zhihui initially rose to fame after being among the popular Huawei \"Genius Youth\" program members, whereby he created advanced AI projects. His brilliant innovations, including a robotic arm modelled after Iron Man, attracted attention on the web and drew a large number of followers under the nickname \"Zhihuijun.\" After graduating with a degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and working as an employee with the smartphone company Oppo, Peng left Huawei in 2022 to achieve a more challenging-to-reach goal&mdash;one that culminated in creating AgiBot in 2023.<br><br>Since its inception in Shanghai, AgiBot has grown very fast.

This positions the company alongside multinational corporations such as Tesla, which is also scaling up production of its Optimus humanoid robot program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The success is attributed to the leadership of Peng Zhihui. In addition to innovation and scale, he has assisted AgiBot in attracting top talent.

Luo has worked with AI pioneer Sergey Levine in the past, and his hiring marks a significant victory for AgiBot\'s research credibility and competitiveness worldwide.<br><br>Encounters with influential individuals like Premier Li Qiang and President Xi Jinping don\'t always translate to cash being handed out, but they generally yield proof of support that can be translated into cooperation with the government, securing grants, and attracting investment.

As the founder and CEO of Myavana, a beauty tech company based in Atlanta, she has built a powerful platform that provides AI hair care for Black women, tailored to each user&rsquo;s unique texture, health, and lifestyle.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And now, with national media coverage like MSN\'s <em>&ldquo;Myavana&rsquo;s Mission to Map the DNA of Beauty and Identity&rdquo;</em>, the world is beginning to understand just how big her vision truly is.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From Coding to Curls: The Birth of Myavana</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A computer science graduate from Georgia Tech, Candace Mitchell Harris was already a rising star in tech when she realized the beauty industry wasn&rsquo;t designed for her hair&mdash;or for the millions of women who shared her experience. Frustrated by the endless trial-and-error of buying hair products, she decided to take a scientific approach.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;I examined my hair under a microscope,&rdquo; she recalled in interviews. &ldquo;I realized no one was applying science to our hair, and that&rsquo;s when the idea for Myavana was born.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Founded in 2012, Myavana&mdash;a blend of &ldquo;my hair&rdquo; and &ldquo;nirvana&rdquo;&mdash;uses AI and hair strand analysis to provide custom hair care recommendations. With over a decade of R&amp;D and customer feedback, it&rsquo;s become a trusted platform for textured hair solutions that are accurate, culturally aware, and grounded in data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>HairAI&trade;: Personalized Beauty Powered by Science</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the heart of Myavana is its proprietary technology, HairAI&trade;, which uses machine learning to assess hair texture, type, density, and health from a single photo or strand. Users either upload images of their hair or send in samples using a Hair Analysis Kit. The result? A scientifically backed, fully customized regimen for hair care&mdash;including product recommendations and style suggestions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This AI-driven model doesn&rsquo;t just serve individuals. Myavana also supports salons and stylists, helping professionals better understand the science of hair and provide elevated services to their clients.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Mapping the DNA of Identity</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/myavanas-mission-to-map-the-dna-of-beauty-and-identity/ar-AA1Cw2FA?ocid=BingNewsVerp\"> recent feature by MSN</a></span>, Mitchell Harris shared her deeper mission: to map the DNA of beauty and identity. Her work is more than just innovation&mdash;it&rsquo;s cultural restoration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;For far too long, textured hair was misunderstood, misrepresented, or simply ignored in science and commerce,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not just recommending products&mdash;we&rsquo;re validating beauty, celebrating identity, and giving women the power to understand themselves through the lens of science.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The article highlights how Myavana is not just revolutionizing beauty but empowering women through technology that affirms their individuality and cultural legacy. In doing so, Harris is redefining what beauty tech can&mdash;and should&mdash;look like.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Filling a Market Gap with AI Hair Care for Black Women</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although Black women spend nine times more on hair products than other demographics, the market has historically failed to meet their needs with science-based solutions. That&rsquo;s why AI hair care for Black women stands out as such a vital innovation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Myavana fills this gap by using culturally competent, data-driven analysis. From hair density and porosity to strand strength and environmental damage, Myavana&rsquo;s system considers over 20 variables. Users no longer need to guess which products might work&mdash;they now have access to personalized insights backed by real science.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From Startup to $50 Million Valuation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Myavana has attracted major investments from Amazon, Ulta Beauty&rsquo;s Prisma Ventures, and H/L Ventures, raising nearly $6 million in funding. Today, the company is valued at over $50 million and continues to grow through its app, Pro Hair Labs for stylists, and enterprise solutions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Candace Mitchell Harris has also received national honors, including Forbes 30 Under 30, the BET Honors STEM Award, and recognition by WWD as one of the Top 50 Beauty Innovators.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Bridging Technology and Culture</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Located in Atlanta&mdash;a historic hub for Black entrepreneurship&mdash;Myavana is continuing the legacy of icons like Madam C.J. Walker. But as the MSN article noted, Candace is blending heritage with hardware, creating a beauty brand that is just as scientific as it is soulful.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The company&rsquo;s headquarters even sit just blocks from where Walker herself once ran her hair empire.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead: The Future of AI Hair Care for Black Women</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Looking ahead, Mitchell Harris envisions a future where Myavana becomes a global standard. Plans are in motion to install hair analysis kiosks in salons and beauty retailers across the U.S. and abroad, including Africa and the Caribbean.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">She also hopes to partner with hair care brands to design new products based on real consumer hair data, leading to formulations tailored not just by type but by individual hair profiles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By using artificial intelligence to elevate beauty routines and build deeper cultural confidence, AI hair care for Black women is set to become more than just a trend&mdash;it&rsquo;s poised to become the new industry norm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Candace Mitchell Harris isn&rsquo;t just the Founder of a fast-growing beauty tech company. She&rsquo;s a visionary shaping the future of inclusive innovation. With Myavana, she&rsquo;s giving Black women access to science, self-discovery, and smart, confident hair care&mdash;on their terms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And for millions of women who&rsquo;ve long felt left out of the beauty conversation, that&rsquo;s more than innovation&mdash;it&rsquo;s empowerment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-11', '22:52:37', 'ai-hair-care-for-black-women-is-getting-personal-with-technology', 'article/visionaries-network-ai-hair-care-for-black-women1.webp', 'AI hair care for Black women is getting personal with technology', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-ai-hair-care-for-black-women1.webp', 4, 2025, 'AI hair care, Black women, personalized beauty, textured hair, natural hair, tech in beauty, hair technology, Black hair AI, smart hair tools, beauty innovation, curly hair, AI products, ethnic hair, AI beauty trends, visionaries network', 'Discover how AI is revolutionizing hair care for Black women with personalized solutions for natural and textured hair needs.', 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

It is a significant milestone in its expansion in the region and worldwide. With a 153% revenue growth year on year and a significant rise in transaction volumes, Airwallex Singapore&rsquo;s growth in 2024 indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Southeast Asia desire additional digital financial solutions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The firm\'s robust Q4 performance was the main driver of its success, and revenues surged 215% YoY while transaction volume grew 192%. In the full fiscal year, Singapore\'s transaction volume grew 159%, a testament to the city-state\'s strategic value as a fintech hub and digital innovation leader.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">2024 was a new era of expansion for us in Singapore and regionally,\" said <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/awxlucy/\">Lucy Liu, Airwallex President and Co-founder</a></span>. \"Our results show the strength of delivering businesses access to next-generation infrastructure that unlocks cross-border potential.\".</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Singapore as Hub of Choice</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Airwallex chose Singapore as its primary headquarters, which has greatly contributed to its rapid expansion. In 2024, locally, the business employed 58% more personnel, with over 250 people in corporate, commercial, and product development staff. The PED team expanded broadly, with an increase of new hires by 98%, while the business reinforced its AI, data, and engineering capabilities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To support this expansion, Airwallex expanded its office footprint in Guoco Tower, a reflection of its long-term strategy of leading innovation in Singapore and beyond.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>SMEs are responsible for growth</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among the most important reasons for Airwallex Singapore\'s growth in 2024 has been its focus on helping SMEs scale and digitalize. Airwallex has partnered with an expanding list of <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../magazine/innovation-excellence-awards-2023-sent\">innovative brands</a></span> like Endowus, Love, Bonito, and Mighty Jaxx, while continuing to maintain relationships with long-standing partners like EU Holidays, Far East Flora, and Huber\'s Butchery.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Airwallex realized the issues that small and medium-sized businesses in Singapore are facing, so they sent a survey to 250 Singaporean small and medium-sized business leaders. They found common challenges such as increased costs, inadequate skilled workers, and cash flow issues, yet also revealed a strong appetite to grow despite them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Key Survey Discoveries:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; 62% of SMEs mention increasing the cost of operations as a key issue</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; 48% attribute difficulties in managing global and local cash flow</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; 43% are impacted by inflation</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; 40% struggle with regulatory complexity</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; 46% view too few workers as a challenge to growth</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In spite of all these challenges, SMEs remain optimistic. 76% intend to raise business expenditure in 2024, with 33% investing huge amounts in expansion. Expansion is still the top priority, with 40% of the survey respondents looking towards Southeast Asia, 37% towards East Asia, and 30% towards Central Asia.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Digital finance is expanding rapidly</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The survey further pointed to an overwhelming shift to FinTech and digital platforms. Nearly 96% of the SMEs that were polled already have or plan to adopt digital finance platforms in order to streamline their operations. These platforms process transactions more efficiently, cost less, are more transparent, and offer more features than banking systems.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Surprisingly, 91% of people surveyed reported that they trust online financial platforms such as Airwallex to handle their finances&mdash;a striking reversal in sentiment that reflects the growing influence of online financial resources.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"SMEs power Singapore\'s economy, constituting 99% of businesses and almost half of the GDP,\" Airwallex\'s Southeast Asia Head, Ershad Ahamed, clarified. \"Our research indicates that SMEs want to scale but are held back by very real constraints. We want to give them scalable, intuitive tools that make their finances easy.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Growing Overseas but Contributing Locally</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beyond Singapore, Airwallex is accelerating its global expansion. In January 2025, the business launched its New Zealand operations and acquired CTIN Pay, a licensed intermediary payment service provider in Vietnam. They are just some of a broader push to expand its Asia-Pacific footprint and help businesses navigate global markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Airwallex\'s numbers do the talking: the business now makes more than US$600 million in revenue every year and processes over US$130 billion in annualised transaction value. Its work has not fallen on deaf ears&mdash;Airwallex has just been named one of Fast Company\'s 2025 World\'s Most Innovative Companies, hailed for its reinvention of cross-border financial innovation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As digital transformation accelerates in the majority of industries, Airwallex Singapore&rsquo;s growth in 2024 emerges as a pioneer in new financial services.

(114, NULL, 'How 6G Will Revolutionize Connectivity by 2025', 'How 6G Technology Will Transform Connectivity by 2025', 'Voice', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We are at the start of yet another gigantic technological shift. The focus is moving away from 5G and to 6G technology, which is of paramount importance today. By 2025, we will see the first clear signals of what 6G can do. If we get ready, this new network will transform the way we are connected, create, and flourish in the&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/westown-smart-city-south-africa-set-to-transform-kwazulu-natal\">digital realm</a></span>.<br><br>Let us be realistic: 6G is more than a wireless communications revolution. It is an evolutionary change in the way that we think of connectivity, innovation, and worldwide collaboration. It will make us rethink the function of networks within our world&mdash;not only as technologies but as the intangible force driving an intelligent, leaner, and more interconnected world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Beyond Speed: The True Power of 6G</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yes, 6G networks will be extremely fast&mdash;extremely fast. We are discussing potential speeds of 1 terabit per second and very low latency. But only focusing on speed would be a mistake. The true power of 6G technology is its capability to perform things that today\'s networks cannot: real-time immersive experiences, holographic communication, self-driving systems, and machine-to-machine intelligence on a scale we have never experienced before.<br><br>With these abilities, 6G will not only improve our lives&mdash;it will revolutionize them. Picture smart cities that can function on their own, remote treatments that are indistinguishable from in-person care, and metaverse environments that allow for frictionless collaboration and shopping in fully immersive virtual worlds. These are not far-off dreams&mdash;they are on the horizon, and 6G upgrades will be the catalyst for making them a reality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future of Connectivity Must Be Inclusive&mdash;If Only We Act Now</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We can\'t repeat past mistakes in deploying networks. 5G was promising but widened the digital divide in most areas. With 6G, we can make it right. Everyone should have access to high-speed internet, anywhere, including rural and underserved areas. This needs to be a priority for 6G.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As we move towards 2025, we must insist that governments, technology leaders, and infrastructure providers put equitable access first. If next-generation networks are to make the world a better place, they need to reach every nook and cranny of it&mdash;not just the wealthiest or most populous.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Innovation Requires 6G</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let\'s not overlook how important <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/6G\">6G technology</a></span> will be for innovation. Digital twins, automation by AI, self-driving cars, and advanced robots are already testing the limits of what 5G can do. 6G will do away with those limits, providing creators and businesses with a space where their actions and thoughts are not limited by data speed and latency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We need to see 2025 as a tipping point. Not because 6G will be entirely operational but because the beginning of its adoption and infrastructure building will start to put us on track for it. This is the point at which startups, developers, and businesses can begin to tinker with 6G applications that are greater than mere basic connections&mdash;moving towards completely new ways of generating value.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Privacy, Security, and Responsibility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As we build these networks, we need to do it properly. 6G networks will generate and manage a vast amount of data. This raises serious issues regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and technology ethics. If we do not have proper rules, we may be building a system of spying in disguise as new technology.<br><br>Let\'s get real: we\'re more likely to create new technology than we are to argue about ethics and regulations. In 6G, we can\'t afford to let that occur. We require systems with security built in from the beginning, safeguarding user data at all levels and offering transparent AI integration. If 6G is to be the nervous system of our digital world, then trust must be its foundation.<br><br><strong>Why 2025 Matters</strong><br><br>Others will insist that it\'s too early to talk about 6G in 2025. But we at Visionaries Network don\'t agree. By the year 2025, prime nations such as South Korea, China, America, and Europe will be greatly engaged in researching, testing, and beginning the deployment of 6G. Those who will do best are those who are planning and executing now&mdash;not sitting and waiting.<br><br>As a world community, we must view 6G technology as something that we all own and are responsible for. It\'s not merely about developing the next big thing; it\'s about developing the digital world that we will all live in for many years to come.<br><strong><br>A Call to Action</strong><br><br>We are at a special point in time. The decisions we make in the next two years will decide if 6G helps humanity or harms it. Let\'s make educated decisions.<br><br>We need to invest in STEM education, support research on 6G, and facilitate inclusive infrastructure development. We need to create vision-driven, accountable public-private partnerships. And we need to make sure that 6G does more than connect devices&mdash;it needs to connect people, ideas, and opportunities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The journey towards 6G technology is not without challenges. Yet, if we come together&mdash;across industries, governments, and societies&mdash;we can make the future about how connection drives us forward, rather than what tears us apart. Let us not wait for the future to come. Let us create it today.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-11', '23:14:25', 'how-6g-technology-will-transform-connectivity-by-2025', 'article/visionaries-network-6g-technology-connectivity.webp', 'How 6G Technology Will Transform Connectivity by 2025', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-6g-technology-connectivity.webp', 4, 2025, '6G technology, connectivity, 2025, future networks, ultra-fast internet, smart cities, IoT, AI, latency, wireless innovation, telecom, 6G applications, visionaries network, tech trends, mobile networks', 'Explore how 6G technology is set to transform global connectivity by 2025 with faster speeds, lower latency, and smarter networks.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The center of this revolution is Funbet Casino NZ, one of the giants of online casinos that is aggressively leveraging the technology of live-streaming to establish a more real, thrilling, and immersive gaming experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Older online casino games are usually based on algorithms and random number generators, but that is changing fast. With live-streaming technology, gamers can now experience real-time action with professional dealers, broadcast in real-time to their devices in HD. This technology closes the gap between online and real-world casinos, with an experience that feels real and open.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Real-Time Interaction and Greater Trust</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the principal benefits of this technology is that it enables gamers to converse with actual dealers and other gamers in real time. With high-quality live streaming, gamers can see every deal, spin, and shuffle as it happens. This instills gamer trust and dispels suspicion regarding whether the game is fair.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://funbet.com/nz/\">Funbet Casino NZ</a></span> has incorporated full live-streaming functionality into its website, and it has a wide variety of live dealer games, including blackjack, roulette, and baccarat.

Players can communicate with dealers and interact with other players, which makes the game more vibrant and community-oriented. This interactive feature provides more thrill and enjoyment that cannot be delivered by conventional digital games.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sociality is greatly promoted at Funbet Casino NZ. The site promotes conversation and communication; hence, each gaming session feels like an evening with friends. Whether through events or tournament games, the site is always adapting to what the contemporary online casino game players want.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Remaining Ahead with Innovation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What sets Funbet Casino NZ apart is its focus on using the latest broadcasting equipment and live casino software to deliver seamless, high-definition play. Their website is optimized to handle rapid connections, low latency, and seamless streaming&mdash;making it one of New Zealand\'s best live gaming websites.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the future, live-streaming technology in online casinos will improve. With advancements in 4K streaming, virtual reality, and more intuitive interfaces, online gambling will surely be more immersive and interactive.

Netflix\'s AI search engine, also being tested on a small group of customers in New Zealand and Australia, runs on OpenAI language models and could change the way tens of millions of viewers decide what to watch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>AI Brings Conversational Search to the Streaming Experience</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The feature, so far only present in Netflix\'s iOS app, will replace the company\'s current search feature and let users search based on more conversational, descriptive terms&mdash;states of mind, themes, or even vague descriptions of content. No more having to type out exact titles or actor names will be required, but the AI search engine operated by Netflix will interpret searches along the lines of \"humoristic crime comedies with dark twists\" or \"happy dog movies\" in order to provide relevant, vetted results.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Powered by OpenAI, Designed for Personalization</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to a report by Bloomberg, the AI model that supports the new search function is developed in partnership with <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2024/06/openai-launched-chatgpt-edu\">OpenAI</a></span>, although the company did not specify what model it uses.

Netflix representative MoMo Zhou told The Verge that there are \"currently no plans to expand outside of iOS\" during this initial period, though internal conversations suggest a wider rollout in the months ahead, including possible availability in the United States and other major markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nonetheless, this technology has its critics. The entertainment world&mdash;actors and writers foremost&mdash;has complained about the potential for AI to help trim costs or replace creative work. These were the prevailing concerns of Hollywood walkouts last year. Netflix officials, like <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedsarandos/\">Co-CEO Ted Sarandos</a></span>, have pushed back by saying that AI is designed to supplement&mdash;not replace&mdash;human imagination.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Netflix has also experimented with AI outside of content recommendation, including content localization and film production software. In 2024, Netflix employed AI-based dubbing and automated subtitle generation to localize its original content faster and better.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future of Streaming: Personalized, AI-Driven Discovery</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the AI search engine at Netflix continues to develop based on user feedback, its broader release may have the potential to revolutionize how humans interact with streaming services.

It\'s not merely a costly car&mdash;it could prove to be the affordable EV scooter in India that still has the best technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Features That Exceed the Basics</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tesseract also features at the top level that one would associate with expensive <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/jeff-bezos-bets-on-affordable-electric-pickup-truck-maker\">automobiles.</a></span> It includes hill-hold assist, traction control, and regenerative braking. Standout features include the radar-based safety system. There is a radar at the front that scans the road in front and alerts the rider via vibrations on the handlebar. Blind-spot warnings are given in the mirrors, and a 360-degree sensing system alerts the rider of traffic in every direction.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The flagship variant receives a 6kWh battery, giving it a range of more than 260 km on a single charge, and 20 horsepower&mdash;some of India\'s most powerful scooters. But the largest selling point may be the price. The base version was launched at â‚¹1,45,000 with an exclusive â‚¹25,000 discount for the first 10,000 buyers. That dropped the price to â‚¹1.2 lakh, one of India\'s lowest EV scooters for what it is.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Overwhelming Demand by Indian Buyers </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The reaction was instant and huge. \"We received over 20,000 bookings in two days,\" Subramaniam reported.

Bookings touched 40,000 units in 10 days.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Indian consumer is waiting for smart, high-power scooters,\" Rajmohan said. \"We wanted to give customers something that is fun but functional.\" The scooter also features 14-inch wheels for better road grip and a 34-litre under-seat storage for a helmet and backpack.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Global Dreams, Indian Roots</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ultraviolette is not lagging either.

The Tesseract is also built to international standards, and exports are on the cards. The company has 15 Indian city showrooms so far and wants to open more. They\'re even constructing a new factory with a capacity to produce 300,000 cars per year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Built in India, Backed by Innovation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ultraviolette gets most of its critical components from Indian suppliers, such as cutting-edge chips from Qualcomm. India\'s EV manufacturing base is much stronger now, the founders claim, and it is easier for startups to procure high-value components and ramp up production.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While some of the components&mdash;battery cells and some components of the motor, for example&mdash;continue to be foreign-origin, the local industry is catching up at a rapid rate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Besides the Tesseract scooter, Ultraviolette has also rolled out another lightweight e-bike named Shockwave.

Fartcoin gain, driven by speculative forces and hype, has caught the attention of both veterans in cryptocurrencies as well as new investors willing to ride the present wave.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Fartcoin Origins: A Memecoin Conceived in Humor</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The history of Fartcoin is as fantastical as its name. It was born out of a fictional exchange in the Truth Terminal AI agent model, where it was proposed that a cryptocurrency founded on Elon Musk\'s alleged love of the sound of farts would catch on. The silly and absurd notion took off in a hurry. Its light-heartedness appealed to early adopters, and the memecoin became a sensation as the popularity of AI agents was at its peak in late October.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fartcoin was built on the Solana blockchain platform, which provides low and fast transactions. Although no tremendous technological breakthroughs were achieved, the value of the coin is partly due to cultural appropriateness and humor, and not practical usefulness. This approach has worked, and the token has attracted investors who are meme coin fans that enjoy the humor and community-based narrative surrounding the token.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Role of Community and Early Investors</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Contrary to expectations, the launch of Fartcoin did not depend significantly on social media fame. Fartcoin\'s Twitter account has merely 22,000 followers&mdash;much lower than rival memecoins Shiba Inu or Dogecoin. Nevertheless, Fartcoin\'s initial success is traceable to early buzz-building and early speculation. Fartcoin appealed to speculators since they could buy a ridiculous and inexpensive asset that might boom in value.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Early institutional buyers also contributed significantly to increasing the legitimacy and market liquidity of the coin. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.sigilfund.com/\">The Sigil Fund</a></span>, a reputable regulated crypto investment company, bought around $191,000 worth of Fartcoin soon after its launch, providing the coin with a degree of credibility that most other memecoins do not have.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Fartcoin Price Rockets: Why the Boom? </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Several reasons have propelled Fartcoin\'s explosive growth. One was when it was added to Binance Futures, one of the world\'s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The announcement prompted a 21% price surge on Dec. 18, 2024, drawing the attention of retail and institutional investors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the wider cryptocurrency market struggled with macroeconomic issues, Fartcoin\'s offbeat past gave risk-averse investors a welcome break. It also rode the ongoing interest in meme coins, a sector that created wild but frequently rewarding volatility. This helped to create a steep Fartcoin gain over a relatively short timescale, drawing in even more investors and sending it ever higher.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s the Future of Fartcoin? Price Projections and Risks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fartcoin\'s future is uncertain. While its price rose in 2024, meme coins are naturally volatile. Price volatility is the norm, with Fartcoin fluctuating between $0.02 and $1.30 within several weeks. Fartcoin\'s destiny will largely depend on the long-term popularity of its user base and the overall sentiment towards meme coins.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For 2025, price speculation puts Fartcoin at $2.50 if it stays on its current trajectory. If demand dies down or regulatory problems stand in the way, it\'s under $0.50. Investors must take into account the risk of investing in a coin so valuable only because it\'s new.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Fartcoin vs Other Memecoins: A Different Stand</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Compared to more established ones like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, Fartcoin is unique in its combination of humor and absurdity. Of course, compared to Dogecoin, whose usability is higher and better understood by mainstream markets, Fartcoin is limited to its niche. Fartcoin\'s lack of usability also puts it below newer projects, like Crypto All-Stars, which combine meme culture with real utilities like staking rewards and cross-chain support.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion: Fartcoin\'s Journey in the World of Cryptocoins </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fartcoin\'s rise to a $1 billion market cap is evidence of the speculative and volatile nature of the crypto market. Though its popularity is a testament to the depth of humor and folkloric storytelling, its sustainability will be contingent upon whether or not it can transcend its status as a joke.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As an investment opportunity, Fartcoin is a high-risk, reward-high gamble&mdash;to be entered into cautiously. As the meme coin world matures, Fartcoin\'s story will be a lesson in the collision of hype, humor, and speculation. Whether it will be a flash in the pan or a permanent fixture in the crypto world is yet to be determined. Meanwhile, Fartcoin is an intriguing anomaly, a window into the mercurial world of cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-04-15', '00:30:36', 'fartcoin-gain-sends-shockwaves-through-the-memecoin-market', 'article/visionaries-network-fartcoin.webp', 'Fartcoin Gain Sends Shockwaves Through the Memecoin Market', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-fartcoin.webp', 4, 2025, 'Fartcoin, memecoin, crypto, cryptocurrency, altcoin, blockchain, coin market, crypto surge, visionaries network, meme, trading, investment, digital asset, crypto news, DeFi', 'Fartcoin&#039;s unexpected price surge sends shockwaves through the memecoin market, capturing investor attention and driving major trading volume.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

He also announced that he was considering changes to a proposed 25% tariff on automobiles and auto parts from Mexico, Canada, and other countries.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The sudden announcement produced a change in investor sentiment, and risk-on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum were among the gainers of the good news.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At 11:14 AM IST, Bitcoin price after the Trump news stood at $85,804, a 1.7% rise in the last 24 hours. Ethereum also rose, up 1.3% to $1,645.

For instance, Strategy just bought 3,459 BTC worth $285.8 million.

Strategy and Metaplanet purchased a combined total of $311 million of Bitcoin, which speaks volumes about confidence in BTC\'s future,\" Subburaj said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to CryptoCompare, weekly volume in Bitcoin increased by 15% as evidence of increasing demand from retail and institutional investors. Ethereum also reported consistent gains in line with the overall euphoria engendered by the U-turn by the U.S. government.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Mixed Bag for Altcoins</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The altcoin market gave a mixed response. BNB, XRP, Toncoin, and Litecoin rose by as much as 3%, while Solana, Tron, Dogecoin, Cardano, Sui, and Shiba Inu fell by as much as 2%. While there was a fall, analysts say these coins might rebound if positive sentiment remains in the broader crypto market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Bitcoin Market Data After Tariff Readjustment </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Following the tariff announcement, Bitcoin\'s market cap rose to $1.701 trillion, and its dominance rose to 62.9%. Nevertheless, Bitcoin\'s daily trading volume dropped slightly by 3.3% to $29.37 billion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Stablecoins dominated trading volume at 93% of the total crypto market activity.

The game is complemented by the Wheel Bonus, the signature of the popular TV gameshow, and offers Wheel of Fortune fans a full-circle experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why This Matters in the Casino World</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">IGT\'s new title isn\'t merely a game release &mdash; it\'s a risk that further cements their position in the international gaming marketplace. Wheel of Fortune Video Poker Las Vegas is more than a new flashy machine; it\'s a strategic blend of popular game styles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-khin-77ab354/\">Nick Khin, President of Global Gaming at IGT</a></span>, referred to the launch as \"an important milestone in the deployment of our expanded Wheel of Fortune games portfolio.\" And what better place to do it than Las Vegas, generally regarded as the world\'s largest video poker market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Wheel of Fortune Goes Online and International </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">IGT\'s ride on the Wheel of Fortune brand extends beyond land casinos. In 2023, IGT signed a 10-year licensing agreement with Sony Pictures Television that gave IGT exclusive rights to produce Wheel of Fortune-branded products in gaming, lottery, iGaming, and iLottery.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among the largest milestones was the introduction of the Wheel of Fortune Online Casino, which was created in collaboration with BetMGM. Initially introduced in New Jersey, the online casino introduced a portfolio of licensed games to online gamers, such as Wheel of Fortune Megaways and Power Wedges.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Following the American launch, the virtual casino launched into the regulated Ontario market, opening the historic name to Canadian players.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>\"Introducing Wheel of Fortune Casino in Ontario is a part of our effort to bring players the games they love and an entertaining experience with a classic game show,\"</em> said Matt Prevost, chief revenue officer of BetMGM.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Final Spin </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With its mix of high-stakes action, brand favorite, and Vegas spectacle, Wheel of Fortune Video Poker Las Vegas will be among the most exciting game releases of 2025.

Leading the charge is&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.aveva.com/\">Aveva Group</a></span>, UK industrial software giant now wholly owned by Schneider Electric. The firm is driving its partners forward with an irresistible agenda: converting specialist knowledge into scalable services through a Knowledge-as-a-Service platform.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Aveva\'s Ambitious Gamble on a Platform Future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aveva\'s vision is to see beyond tool selling&mdash;it\'s about empowering partners with the ability to provide smart, reusable, AI-driven solutions based on vast industry expertise. Tim Sowell, lead digital portfolio strategy, and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeylebedev/\">Alexey Lebedev, vice president of Pacific</a></span>, described how Aveva is enabling its ecosystem to shift from conventional system integrators to domain-specific solution providers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We consider ourselves to be offering an informatics Connect Platform,\" Sowell said. \"We\'re adding blocks on top of that&mdash;what we refer to as the purple Aveva blocks&mdash;that embody our 50 years of experience in agents and components.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From Service Providers to Knowledge Experts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These \"purple blocks\" of modular capability allow partners to deliver customized solutions like pump optimisation, not just once, but as a reproducible service across industries. Take Harmony Gold, a leading South African mining conglomerate. Without in-house pump performance expertise, it partnered with a former system integrator who now delivers that customized service via Aveva\'s ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That third party isn\'t a consultant anymore&mdash;they\'re a trusted, regular contributor, embedded directly into Harmony\'s systems through the Knowledge-as-a-Service platform.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>&ldquo;This is a change from marketing a product to becoming a part of the customer\'s trusted knowledge network,\"</em> Sowell said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>No More Licensing: The Subscription and SaaS Revolution</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This change is alongside a change away from perpetual licensing and on-prem deployments. As Sowell describes, cloud-based solutions now allow businesses to scale solutions globally&mdash;something that the old on-prem model could not.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;For partners, it\'s a matter of how they consume their IP and present it as reusable knowledge modules,\" Lebedev said. <em>\"We\'re witnessing businesses move away from selling projects and selling insights instead. This is even more potent when delivered via a cloud-based, flexible, and constantly evolving Knowledge-as-a-Service platform.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Various Regions, Various Readiness</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The adoption rate varies across the globe. Whereas the engineering firms in Europe are saturated with long-term projects and keen on injecting know-how into scalable solutions, nations such as Australia are experiencing skill deficits, and hence, reusable, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/ai-powered-stroke-rehabilitation-technology-enhances-patient-safety\">AI-powered solutions</a></span> are more critical.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lebedev added that partners in these markets need to embrace faster deployment models and leave behind huge, packaged deployments. Instead, they need to use data-driven insights and platform services to keep pace.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Aveva\'s Own Transition Reflects Industry Transformation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aveva itself began life as a state-funded CAD center in 1967. After decades of takeover and restructuring, it was acquired by Schneider Electric in 2018 and became fully owned in 2022. Today, Aveva is not just offering design and simulation software&mdash;it\'s offering a platform for partners to build, grow, and monetize their area of expertise.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The company\'s strategy is to empower partners with the capability to bring their skills to the world, using AI, cloud, and real-time data as imperatives. <em>\"The IT world is converging into OT,\"</em> Sowell stated. <em>\"And as IoT grows, the engineering paradigm is shifting, as well.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future Lies in Expertise, Not Tools </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aveva\'s message to partners is straightforward: shake off the mindset of product suppliers, and start thinking as knowledge suppliers. Those who can turn domain expertise into a service will thrive. Those that do not may be left in the dust. By adopting the Knowledge-as-a-Service platform model, Aveva is not merely changing its own business&mdash;but the whole ecosystem that revolves around it too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">&nbsp;</span></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-04-22', '00:34:26', 'aveva-leads-shift-to-knowledge-as-a-service-platform-model', 'article/visionaries-network-aveva-shift-knowledge-as-a-service-platform.webp', 'Aveva Leads Shift to Knowledge-as-a-Service Platform Model', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-aveva-shift-knowledge-as-a-service-platform.webp', 4, 2025, 'Aveva, Knowledge-as-a-Service, KaaS, digital transformation, cloud platform, industrial software, data insights, smart manufacturing, visionaries network, AI, SaaS, enterprise solutions, digital twin, analytics, connected systems', 'Aveva leads the shift to a Knowledge-as-a-Service model, delivering intelligent, connected platforms for smarter industrial operations and insights.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The company\'s rise mirrors the AI boom, which has seen valuations across the industry balloon in recent years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although Guo departed Scale AI only two years after its co-founding, her initial investment has multiplied many times over. But she did not rest on her laurels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After Scale, Guo also co-founded Backend Capital, a venture capital company that invests in early-stage technology startups.

The future of houses is not a distant fantasy but a reality being built by green thinking, innovation, and robots. Welcome to the era of Near-Zero Carbon 3D-Printed Homes Texas, where sustainability and modern style converge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the climate changes accelerate and traditional construction methods fall behind sustainability goals, builders like <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.iconbuild.com/\">ICON</a></span> and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.hive3dbuilders.com/\">Hive 3D Builders</a></span> are looking to new technologies to meet the times. With colossal 3D printers, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/ai-powered-urban-mobility-solutions-transforming-european-cities-for-a-greener-future\">eco-friendly materials</a></span>, and intelligent design, these homes aren\'t just built&mdash;they\'re built for the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why 3D-Printed Houses?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">3D-printed homes have made global news for speed, cost, and capacity to cover housing shortages. In Texas, where growth is booming and the climate is severe, builders are thinking anew about building houses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Instead of traditional wood framing, massive robotic arms pump out sheets of cement-like material to form durable, energy-efficient buildings. The robots employ digital blueprints to print walls in a matter of days, reducing labor and material waste dramatically.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But beyond speed and expense reduction, the real innovation is what the homes are constructed of&mdash;and how businesses like ICON and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://ecomaterial.com/\">Eco Material Technologies</a></span> are conceptualizing differently the blocks upon which the future will be constructed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Green Materials Are Changing the Game</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Regular Portland cement is among the largest carbon emitters in the world, responsible for nearly 8% of all COâ‚‚ emissions. Visionaries Network introduces you to PozzoCEM Vite, a game-changing product from Eco Material Technologies that reduces those emissions by up to 92%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This product is utilized in houses printed by Hive 3D Builders, the first company in Texas to engage in green building. PozzoCEM Vite is produced from industry waste products rather than limestone, reducing carbon emissions in production.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Through the use of energy-efficient design and renewable energy integration, these technologies render Near-Zero Carbon 3D-Printed Homes Texas a sustainable and scalable solution to climate change and housing shortages.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Casitas of The Halles: Round Top\'s Eco Oasis</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Round Top, Texas, something special is being built by a partnership between Hive 3D Builders and Eco Material Technologies. Named The Casitas at The Halles, the project is composed of snug homes from 400 to 900 square feet that are affordable and green.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Made of carbon-reducing PozzoCEM Vite and structured to include smart-home technology and solar energy, these casitas prove that functionality and beauty can go hand-in-hand. With streamlined construction and lower material expenses, Hive 3D Builders is making these casitas available at price levels within the budgets of the ordinary Texan.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a state where affordability usually clashes with green-friendly development, this community is a rare but welcome, win-win.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>ICON and Lennar: The Future in Georgetown</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Hive 3D Builders is leading the charge in Round Top, Austin-based company ICON has teamed up with national homebuilder Lennar and world-renowned architectural firm BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) to construct the world\'s largest 3D-printed community in Georgetown, Texas.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This high-profile project at Wolf Ranch includes 100 homes printed on ICON\'s Vulcan industrial-grade robot printer and a custom compound called Lavacrete&mdash;engineered to be durable and long-lasting. The homes offer three to four bedrooms, luxury insulation, and solar-ready roofs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As told by residents interviewed by The Cool Down, not only do the homes look wonderful, but they are also naturally cooler and more insulated than their conventional counterparts. \"The most energy-efficient home I\'ve ever lived in,\" one resident said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is not a future model&mdash;it\'s a thriving community, built for families, working professionals, and environmental consumers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Texas Is Leading the Way</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Texas is in a prime position to lead the 3D-printed housing revolution. With plenty of land area, regulatory flexibility, and growing demand for affordable housing, the state offers an ideal proving ground for new construction technologies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Severe weather events like heat waves and floods also require that homes be not only affordable but also resilient. The combination of strength, speed, and sustainability in these new homes is an appealing solution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And as ICON and Hive 3D Builders have demonstrated, Near-Zero Carbon 3D-Printed Homes Texas are not a trend&mdash;they\'re a blueprint for scalable, habitable, and climate-resilient communities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead: A New Age of Construction</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These developments in Georgetown and Round Top are just the start. ICON is working with NASA on space applications, in addition to constructing affordable housing for Austin\'s homeless. Hive 3D Builders, meanwhile, is pushing forward with their affordable, eco-friendly means of delivering green homes to even more Texans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And with the technology continuing to develop and with growing awareness, 3D-printed homes will be the norm across America. Conclusion: Texas Builds Smarter Texas has always been big-thinkin, and now it\'s smart-building.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks to visionaries such as ICON, Hive 3D Builders, Lennar, and Eco Material Technologies, sustainable housing has a place in the real world in the Lone Star State.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the intersection of climate challenges, affordability crises, and housing deficits becomes more ubiquitous, the solution may be arising from the ground up, layer by layer. And if the remainder of the country is listening, Near-Zero Carbon 3D-Printed Homes, Texas may soon be more than a local phenomenon&mdash;soon they might be a national standard.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'Visionaries NetworkVisionaries', '2025-04-22', '00:34:43', 'inside-texass-near-zero-carbon-3d-printed-homes', 'article/visionaries-network-inside-texas-near-zero-carbon-3d-printed-home.webp', 'Inside Texas&#039;s Near-Zero Carbon 3D-Printed Homes', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-inside-texas-near-zero-carbon-3d-printed-home.webp', 4, 2025, '3D-printed homes, Texas housing, sustainable homes, near-zero carbon, green building, eco-friendly construction, carbon neutral, renewable energy, smart homes, innovative housing, visionaries network, sustainable living, prefab homes, energy-efficient, future homes', 'Explore Texas&rsquo;s innovative 3D-printed homes built with near-zero carbon impact&mdash;leading the way in sustainable, affordable, and eco-friendly housing.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

(144, '', 'GenAI Research Slows Amid Industry Disputes', 'GenAI Research Delayed Over Industry Battle Slows Progress', 'Voice', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As generative AI moves from research technology to a powerful commercial force, one unsettling reality has become the hallmark of the landscape: GenAI research is delayed because of industry rivalry. What was once an open, robust research ecosystem is now fragmenting into rival factions, each holding its intellectual property close. The implications of this shift aren\'t academic&mdash;they\'re global, and they affect everything from small startups to nations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Generative AI (GenAI) was built on the basis of transparency. The most capable models and best approaches were, at some point or another, freely shared with researchers in academia, nonprofits, and industry. Openness fueled innovation, and the area improved rapidly in language generation, image generation, and deep architectures. But in a matter of only a few years, things have changed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Secrecy now reigns in the field. Organizations like <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a></span>, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://deepmind.google/\">Google DeepMind</a></span>, Meta, and Anthropic are more concerned today with guarding their datasets and algorithms. Walled APIs, restricted licensing, proprietary models, and vague or non-existent research papers are the norm. Collaboration has been replaced by competition, and the prospect of losing a market advantage has led one-time collaborative organizations to shut down.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This dynamic is central to the problem&mdash;GenAI Research Delayed Over Industry Battle. It\'s not a short-term pause or a modest deceleration. It\'s a paradigm shift in how <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/ai-hair-care-for-black-women-is-getting-personal-with-technology\">AI</a></span> progress is created and disseminated. And this one, if left uncorrected, could extinguish the field\'s potential for years to come.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rationale for such a retreat from transparency is reasonable from a business point of view. Big generative models are expensive to train. They require big datasets, compute, and engineering talent&mdash;expenses that all too easily sum to hundreds of millions. Companies in a tech-competitive economy are treating their models as trade secrets. The business logic for doing so: the less you know, the more the product must appear to be worth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But while this might safeguard short-term profits, it damages the long-term well-being of the whole field. Innovation is seldom a solo endeavor. It depends on standing on the shoulders of giants, swapping techniques, comparing outcomes, and honing ideas together. When these activities are disrupted, the rate of discovery grinds to a halt.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Worse still, this research bottleneck renders the playing field unequal. Individual research groups, universities, and sole developers simply don\'t have any avenue to acquire the tools or the talent to compete equally with the walled gardens of Big Tech. And the more complex and resource-hungry models become, the wider the \"AI haves\" vs \"AI have-nots\" divide.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The public, too, has much to lose in this bargain. GenAI has incredible potential to benefit society, whether it is initiating customized learning, simulating public health impacts, or streamlining complex scientific research. But some of these socially useful uses are not short-term profit-generating, and thus are not available to corporate aspiration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If a few firms control the course of GenAI, countless humanitarian and academic projects will remain unexplored. This moment demands reconsideration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are ways forward. Public investment in open AI infrastructure can level the playing field. Grants to help academic labs acquire access to high-powered computing and large datasets can help them get back into the conversation. Open-source initiatives, like those of Hugging Face, EleutherAI, and Stability AI, must be backed by grants and incentives. These groups have shown that community-driven development can produce state-of-the-art models without the secrecy and exclusivity of corporate research labs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, governments should ensure that foundational AI capabilities become a public good. Transparency mandates on foundation models, particularly on those affecting public services or security, may be much-needed control. The moment is now to think about whether the development of such powerful tools should actually only be in the private sector.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s time, too, for the sector itself to rethink. There is space for competitive victory and commercial victory without severing the lifelines of collective advancement. Technology firms can look to hybrid models&mdash;where research is made available early stage, and monetization is downstream. The model already exists in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace, where competition and cooperation exist within a balanced system.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the end, the future of GenAI will be determined by the choices we make today. If the current leaders in the field continue to look at research as a battlefield instead of a shared cause, the delays will continue to pile up. And as much as some may triumph in the short term, society as a whole will suffer in the long term.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Innovation happens when ideas are allowed to flow freely, compete with one another, and change. That culture needs to be regained. GenAI Research Delayed Over Industry Battle is not a tech bug&mdash;it\'s a warning. It\'s a matter of whether we will hear it before it\'s too late.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Teamvisiona', '2025-04-24', '10:59:33', 'genai-research-delayed-over-industry-battle-slows-progress', 'article/visionaries-network-gen-ai.webp', 'GenAI Research Delayed Over Industry Battle Slows Progress', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-gen-ai.webp', 4, 2025, 'GenAI, generative AI, AI research, industry conflict, AI development, research delays, tech disputes, innovation slowdown, AI companies, AI ethics, artificial intelligence, visionaries network, tech news, AI progress, AI collaboration', 'Progress in generative AI research is slowing as industry battles over direction, ethics, and control create major delays and tensions.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(148, '', 'Why Superpower&rsquo;s Longevity App Is Booming in 2025', 'Why Superpower&rsquo;s Affordable Longevity App Is Booming', 'Startups', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At 24, Australian businessman&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxmarchione/\">Max Marchione</a></span> is Silicon Valley\'s latest tech and health phenomenon. His company, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://superpower.com/\">Superpower</a></span>, is already making waves for offering a future-oriented but affordable longevity app to health-conscious professionals who desire to live longer, healthier lives. The firm has been worth over $300 million in just two years and just closed a $47 million round.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marchione, a Sydneysider, relocated to San Francisco to start Superpower with the intent to ride two big waves: the imploding U.S. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/u-s--healthcare-system-is-failing-but-personalized-care-offers-hope\">healthcare</a></span> system and the growing demand for personalized, tech-enabled wellness solutions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And it\'s working.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Is Superpower?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Superpower is a yearly subscription longevity app that costs $499. In return, subscribers receive two yearly blood tests tested for dozens of biomarkers. According to the test results, the users receive personalized health recommendations&mdash;like supplements and preventive therapy&mdash;and fast access to healthcare providers via the app.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>\"Superpower is about delivering expert, preventive healthcare to more people,\"</em> Marchione said. <em>\"When I first tested my biological age, it was 35. After completing our own program, it\'s 20.4 now. I feel better, more energetic, and more focused than I ever have before.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His transformation is not just an ad slogan&mdash;it is backed by data and an increasingly strong technology platform for real-time health monitoring and tailored wellness planning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Celebrity and Venture Capital Support</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Investors are fully on board with this new affordable longevity app. Series A funding was provided by Forerunner Ventures, which have made it a known practice to invest in Oura rings, and also involved other top names such as Day One Ventures, Long Journey Ventures, and Winklevoss Capital. Celebrity names such as actress Vanessa Hudgens, DJ Steve Aoki, and Logan Paul are included in the list of investors as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirstengreen/\">Forerunner co-founder Kirsten Green</a></span> is currently on the board of Superpower and believes the company has the potential to disrupt healthcare.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"There\'s a huge gap between what people do know about their bodies and what they might know,\" Green said. <em>\"Superpower bridges that gap.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The app currently boasts a 150,000-person waiting list and has been well-liked by Silicon Valley\'s biohacking set. Its business model features collectible trading cards that are tied to investors\' health data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marchione\'s journey began in Sydney, where he attended St Aloysius College, one of the city\'s elite schools. He started investing in technology at 17 and gave up a top-tier law degree to focus on his entrepreneurial ambitions on a full-time basis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After co-founding Superpower in 2023 with American co-founders <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/unkrich5/\">Kevin Unkrich</a></span> and Jacob Peters, the three took up residence in an apartment-office hybrid in San Francisco, separated by nothing more than a spiral staircase.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>&ldquo;There is no work-life balance&mdash;it\'s just life,\"</em> Marchione said. <em>\"And I feel privileged to be spending it doing something that does make a difference.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His move was not an accident. <em>\"The healthcare shortage is larger in the U.S., people are typically less healthy, and the market is larger,\"</em> he said. <em>\"It\'s the perfect place to start a healthtech business.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Resolving a Personal Issue</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marchione was inspired by his own ailments. He had chronic sinusitis, insomnia, and migraines during his teenage years&mdash;afflictions that were not diagnosed for years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;I kept getting misdiagnosed again and again until I found what I call a \'10x doctor\'&mdash;a physician who listened to my symptoms in totality,\" he said. <em>\"That made me understand how much the system is broken and how valuable individualized health data is.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That epiphany was the template for Superpower. Marchione wants to democratize the kind of luxury healthcare that\'s normally reserved for billionaires such as Jeff Bezos or Peter Thiel&mdash;both of whom have publicly invested in life-extension technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Constructing the Health of the Future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The recently finished $47 million round will go towards expanding Superpower\'s engineering team, expanding its <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/how-to-start-data-analyst-career-a-simple-guide-for-beginners\">data analytics</a></span> platform further, and hiring more medical professionals. Superpower currently has 80 employees, one-third of whom are based in Australia.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While fears that Superpower will widen the healthcare gap exist, Marchione insists that affordability is at the mission\'s center. The affordable longevity app is already being made available to the workers of small businesses, and discussions with health insurers are underway to prolong coverage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Co-founder Kevin Unkrich summarized it most aptly: <em>\"Living with your co-founders is extreme. But building a world-changing company takes extreme focus, discipline, and trust. We\'re not just counting steps&mdash;we\'re redefining health.\"</em><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-25', '23:31:54', 'why-superpowers-affordable-longevity-app-is-booming', 'article/visionaries-network-superpower-app.webp', 'Why Superpower&rsquo;s Longevity App Is Booming in 2025', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-superpower-app.webp', 4, 2025, 'Superpower app, longevity app, health tech, affordable wellness, anti-aging, wellness app, biohacking, health optimization, visionaries network, fitness tracking, personalized health, wellness trends, Superpower longevity, healthy aging, life extension', 'Discover why Superpower&rsquo;s affordable longevity app is booming&mdash;revolutionizing health, wellness, and anti-aging for a growing user base.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

At the heart of its technology is Fybron, a new, biodegradable liquid derived from natural fibers. Fybron can be injected into 3D molds, enabling direct production of soft goods like clothing and footwear&mdash;cutting waste and energy consumption.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This bio-based fashion manufacturing startup seeks to substitute fossil-based, man-made fabrics with a sustainable and scalable alternative that is well-positioned to take advantage of an industry under pressure to minimize its environmental impact.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why This Matters: Scalability and Sustainability</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The $12 million infusion is not about throwing money&mdash;it\'s about a strategic move toward cost competitiveness with traditional manufacturing.

In September 2024, the firm partnered with fashion label Ganni to launch a shoe upper made from cellulose-based Fybron during Paris Fashion Week. The partnership proved that their revolutionary production process can hold its own against high fashion while reducing environmental harm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The firm\'s growing momentum follows a $4.2 million seed round in 2022.

This significant move allows US consumers to utilize Klarna\'s flexible \"Pay in 4\" and longer-term credit products directly on the eBay platform.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eBay Klarna partnership 2025 follows a successful launch in six European nations&mdash;the UK, France, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, and Spain&mdash;last December 2024. The payment options in these markets performed particularly well in high-value segments like electronics, collectibles, and fashion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Millions of American eBay consumers can take advantage in the same manner. Klarna\'s \"Pay in 4\" divides purchases into four interest-free payments, and its financing options provide longer terms on higher-priced items.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Strategic Expansion via Flexible Payments</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This alliance underpins the general market growth strategy of eBay by <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/tapcheck-raises-225m-to-expand-on-demand-pay-platform\">powering the Payments</a></span> and Financial Services business.

We\'re looking forward to bringing our international strategic partnership with Klarna to the US.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eBay Klarna partnership 2025 will enhance the buying power of consumers by providing more payment choices, particularly convenient in the current economy, as consumers are becoming increasingly thrifty.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Circular Commerce: Klarna\'s Resell Tool Goes Live on eBay</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the most innovative features of the alliance is Klarna\'s resale function, which is now available to US consumers through eBay. The function allows consumers to resell products they have already purchased with Klarna&mdash;with product details and images pre-populated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since launching in December 2024, the resell option has already prompted over 500,000 new listings on eBay, signaling heightened consumer demand for the circular economy and sustainable take-up. This aligns with eBay\'s mission of keeping products in use for longer and delivering a quick and simple resale experience to its users.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Klarna US Market Play</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For Klarna, the acquisition further solidifies its footprint in the highly competitive US buy now, pay later (BNPL) space, where <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/smartbiz-becomes-first-fintech-bank-approved-under-trump\">fintech</a></span> giants such as Affirm, Afterpay, and PayPal also vie for domination.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-sykes01/\">David Sykes, Klarna\'s Chief Commercial Officer</a></span>, said:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"eBay is one of the most dynamic marketplaces in the world, offering everything from the mundane to the unusual and unique. With this growth, we\'re giving US consumers the power to buy what they want in more personalized, flexible terms.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Through gaining direct access to eBay\'s vast American consumer base, Klarna is able to promote massive user acquisition for its AI-driven payments app, as well as enhance its merchant relationships and overall US presence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future of Shopping: Flexibility and Sustainability</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The eBay Klarna partnership 2025 is not merely introducing a new payment option&mdash;it\'s about shaping the future of shopping. With growing interest in flexible payments and sustainability, this partnership is for the new-age consumer who wants convenience along with sustainable consumption.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For eBay, it\'s a savvy play as it looks to become more than a resale behemoth, but also a fintech-powered marketplace. For Klarna, it\'s a bold play deeper into integration with one of the internet\'s most recognizable brands.

The action, announced on Friday, reduced the British <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../retail-and-ecommerce\">retailer\'s</a></span> shares by 5%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Popular for its clothing, homeware, and food, Marks &amp; Spencer said the move was a \"proactive management\" response to the incident. The firm said its employees, with the support of leading cyber experts, work around the clock to rebuild its internet services in a secure way.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a post on <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://x.com/x\">X</a></span> (formerly Twitter), Marks &amp; Spencer apologized for the disruption it has caused to customers. It also promised that its physical stores remain open for shopping, as some international websites are also suspending orders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Description of the Incident</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marks &amp; Spencer first revealed the cyber-attack last week, stating that it would lead to some short-term changes to store operations. Customers subsequently experienced contactless payment issues and click-and-collect delays.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Marks &amp; Spencer cyber attack online orders has raised alarm, especially given that nearly a third of the company\'s clothing and home business is conducted online. The prolonged downtime will potentially be a threat to revenue if online shopping is not reinstated in the near future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The National Crime Agency stated that it had knowledge of the incident and was working with the National Cyber Security Centre to help Marks &amp; Spencer with an investigation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer\'s Response</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As part of its recovery process, Marks &amp; Spencer has also gone the precautionary route of suspending all online and app orders. This is to safeguard customers\' details and avoid any further risks as the company recovers its digital systems.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>\"We have a talented team &mdash; supported by leading cyber experts &mdash; working tirelessly to get online and app shopping back to full service,\" </em>Marks &amp; Spencer announced in its official statement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although the Marks &amp; Spencer cyber attack online orders procedure is infuriating for consumers, the shops of the company are open for business as usual. This means customers are still capable of obtaining food, fashion, homeware, and beauty products from stores while digital infrastructure is repaired.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Watershed Moment for Retail Cybersecurity</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">UK high street favorite Marks &amp; Spencer recorded around &pound;13 billion in revenues last year in all its business divisions.

While the scope of the attack is not yet out for public scrutiny, that the company acted swiftly by suspending services is a commendable indication of its care for protecting customers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the same time, Marks &amp; Spencer is encouraging consumers to continue shopping in store and assuring that it will let everyone know when online and app shopping is back to full service.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-26', '23:52:41', 'ms-cyber-attack-halts-online-orders-in-uk-and-ireland', 'article/vsionaries-network-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-online-order-pause.webp', 'Marks &amp; Spencer Cyber Attack Online Orders Paused in UK, Ireland', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/vsionaries-network-marks-and-spencer-cyber-attack-online-order-pause.webp', 4, 2025, 'Marks &amp; Spencer, M&amp;S, cyber attack, online orders, UK, Ireland, data breach, cybersecurity, M&amp;S website, retail cyber attack, shopping disruption, ecommerce, M&amp;S hack, online shopping pause, Visionaries network', 'Marks &amp; Spencer faces a cyber attack, forcing a pause in online orders across the UK and Ireland as security teams work to restore services.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Based on a Bloomberg report, Meta smart glasses October 2025 release date has been announced, and the new model is going to bring electrifying new features.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The future Meta glasses will allegedly come with a small internal display screen. The new functionality will enable users to display images and use basic apps straight from the glasses without the need to constantly connect the glasses to a smartphone. If all goes as planned, the new smart glasses will launch at more than $1,000, which will make them a high-end product compared to previous versions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Meta Smart Glasses October 2025 Release: Ambitious Timelines and Scheduling Issues</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meta seems to be extremely dedicated to the October 2025 deadline. Managers are reported to have instructed teams to work faster, even over weekends, in order for the project to be finished within the strict deadline. Although there is less chance the project is going to be delayed, the company is doing all it can to keep on track. With the Meta smart glasses October 2025 deadline, Meta is keen to be a good role model in the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/google-and-samsung-to-launch-xr-glasses-in-2026-with-smart-features\">wearable technology</a></span> race.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The new release will likely be a paradigm shift in the wearables space. So far, the majority of smart glasses have not been able to offer great design, practical features, and affordable prices. Meta\'s new glasses, if successful, could be a new benchmark.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Apple\'s Secret Smart Glasses \"N50\" and Camera AirPods: Competition Intensifies</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the meantime, Apple is not idle. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/apple-watch-upgrade-set-to-transform-wearables-by-2027\">Apple</a></span>, the tech giant, is quietly working on its own line of smart glasses codenamed \"N50.\" Apple smart glasses N50, while still in their infancy, will be capable of scanning their surroundings and offering them useful information &mdash; a step toward augmented reality, but not entirely entering into it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, Apple is working on another new product: camera AirPods. Camera AirPods would be for people who don\'t want to wear glasses all day but still want some of the same environmental sensing features.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Meta is building a first-mover advantage in the market for smart glasses, industry observers think that the actual competition between Meta and Apple will start in the second half of this decade. Both firms will likely launch fully immersive AR glasses by then, and smart glasses will be as ubiquitous as smartphones are today.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Meta vs Apple: Who Wins the War of Smart Glasses?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s rare to see Apple, the owner of wearables like the Apple Watch, ceding early center stage to another technology behemoth. Meta\'s rapid response with the Meta smart glasses October 2025 project could pay dividends in the short term. Apple\'s past, however, suggests that it likes to mature a technology before it launches a blockbuster.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For now, Meta\'s first priority is clear: get next-generation smart glasses ready for October 2025 and build solid ground in India and other countries with products like the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. If all goes well, the world might be seeing an entirely new way of app, photo, and internet interaction &mdash; all through a cool pair of glasses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-28', '22:58:48', 'meta-smart-glasses-october-2025-new-features-and-launch-details', 'article/visionaries-network-meta-launch-smart-glasses-2025.webp', 'Meta Smart Glasses October 2025: New Features and Launch Details', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-meta-launch-smart-glasses-2025.webp', 4, 2025, 'Meta Smart Glasses, 2025 launch, AR glasses, wearable tech, Meta glasses features, smart eyewear,visionaries network, hands-free tech, Meta innovations, tech launch, smart devices, Meta updates, next-gen glasses, connected eyewear, wearable AI', 'Meta unveils its 2025 Smart Glasses with cutting-edge features, AR capabilities, and hands-free tech designed to elevate daily life and digital interaction.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

These new complexes could help put Zimbabwe on the map as a destination for international business events and exhibitions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Renamed to Zimbabwe International Conference and Exhibition Smart City (ZICES)</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The vision of the grounds is to see it transform into the Zimbabwe International Conference and Exhibition Smart City (ZICES).

With a new convention center, upmarket hotels, and other recreational facilities, the city would be well-positioned to compete in international exhibitions, conferences, and tourist activities. The massive infrastructural push will bring in new investments, increase visitor arrivals, and create employment opportunities for local communities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Theme Park to Acquire Leisure Attractions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among the exciting additions to look forward to on the site is a theme park.

The President Donald Trump administration recently placed steep tariffs, some up to 245%, on a wide range of Chinese imports. The tariffs, which started in early April 2025, led many American companies to suspend Chinese orders temporarily for cost-related reasons.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of Ningbo, Zhejiang province\'s largest office supplies exporters, reported being told by Walmart last week to resume normal shipments. The same directive has been issued to Jiangsu suppliers and other primary manufacturing regions in China. The move is seen as a tactical move by US retailers to stock up ahead of the summer sales season.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Tariffs and Changing Trade Practices</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With tariff uncertainty, the majority of exporters have adjusted their business models. Chinese suppliers are more and more transitioning from Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) terms to Free on Board (FOB) pricing. This allows U.S. importers to take responsibility for tariff handling and customs clearance through their own brokers, giving them more control in managing regulatory changes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A worldwide supplier of garment hangers and packaging reported that U.S. customers began requesting Chinese manufacturers to resume shipments as early as April 23. Walmart China shipments resume news has been creating a ripple effect, as other big-box stores followed to reduce the risk of stock shortages.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Interestingly, Chinese exporters have indicated that US buyers are paying the cost of the new tariffs themselves to a great extent, easing the pressure on Chinese firms and increasing the chances of them continuing to export despite the increased duties.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Retail Giants Warn of Empty-Shelf Woes</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Walmart and Target have reportedly been outspoken in warning the Trump administration of the negative effects of prolonged tariffs. Both CEOs have asserted that the ongoing trade war can lead to global product shortages and push prices higher for ordinary consumers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The retailers made behind-closed-doors sessions with U.S. officials in an attempt to bring attention to the economic and logistics burden imposed by the new tariffs, CBS News reports. As a response, the White House is reportedly considering a working group to examine the supply chain disruptions and inflation threats of the dispute.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Trump has since hinted at the possible reduction of tariff levels, informing Time magazine in an interview that he had phoned Chinese President Xi Jinping to talk of reducing the trade war. Beijing did not, however, confirm the fact of the direct phone call, although it expressed willingness to negotiate&mdash;on the basis of negotiations being conducted on equal terms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why It Matters to Smaller Importers</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Walmart China shipments resume is back in balance is welcome news for multinationals retailing in the United States&mdash;but potentially also for medium and smaller-sized American importers. As China-U.S. shipping dynamics firm up, smaller businesses might find more stable rates for logistics costs as well as improved container availability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Besides, the move to FOB pricing provides such smaller companies greater leeway to deal with tariffs and simplify customs clearance, which is ever more precious in a volatile trade environment. With Chinese manufacturers ramping up production and U.S. retailers in need of restocking, the resumption of shipments is viewed as a cautious but welcome step toward the revival of the U.S.-China trade relationship&mdash;at least on the retail and shipping fronts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-29', '00:01:22', 'walmart-china-shipments-resume-amid-tariff-pressures', 'article/visionaries-network-wallmart-china-us-shipment-terrif.webp', 'Walmart China Shipments Resume Amid Tariff Pressures', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-wallmart-china-us-shipment-terrif.webp', 4, 2025, 'Walmart, China shipments, tariff pressures, US-China trade, supply chain, logistics, retail, visionaries network, cost-cutting, diversification, India imports, trade tensions, sourcing, logistics centers, Walmart suppliers', 'Walmart resumes shipments from China despite tariff pressures, aiming to stabilize supply chains and maintain product availability amid trade tensions.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

No exaggeration. The signs he cites &mdash; from record-high debt to rising joblessness &mdash; are true and disturbing. His \"Great Depression 2025 prediction\" is getting serious attention.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Economic Red Flags Are All Around</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let\'s take a look at the numbers. Americans now have a record $1.21 trillion in credit card debt, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the same time, the U.S. national debt has grown to $36.22 trillion, with worries about long-term fiscal health.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, the labor market is deteriorating. The unemployment rate rose to 4.2% in March 2025, and many workers are facing dwindling 401(k) balances because of market volatility.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kiyosaki is convinced these trends signify more than a recession &mdash; he is concerned there will be a long, ugly downturn. The Robert Kiyosaki Great Depression 2025 prediction lays out the possibility that this crash is going to be more disastrous than even the infamous 1930s financial collapse.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This coming Great Depression will make millions poor&hellip; and a few who act will be very rich and free,\" Kiyosaki cautioned.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Kiyosaki&rsquo;s Solution? Assets That Are Outside the System</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unlike stodgy financial planners of the past, Kiyosaki is not suggesting weathering the storm in a basket of stocks and bonds. Instead, he appears to favor precious metals like gold and silver &mdash; assets not beholden to national currency or central banks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kiyosaki has quoted bullish price targets that represent his long-term bullishness:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Bitcoin: $1 million a coin by 2035</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Gold: $30,000 an ounce</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo3;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Silver: $3,000 per coin</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though these figures may seem extreme, they\'re repeated by other optimistic voices.

Near the end of 2023, he predicted gold going over $2,100 an ounce. In April 2025, gold sits at around $3,300, well on its way to its further-down-the-road target of $3,700 or more.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gold has long been a haven, and global turmoil in recent years has caused demand to hit record highs.

This is the clinic\'s first treatment of this focused therapy &mdash; opening up new hope for those needing relief from pain without surgery or drugs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Chapter in Non-Surgical Joint Therapy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Treatment has been available since 25 April 2025 and is for arthritis, fracture, sprained ligaments, and other degenerative and traumatic conditions of smaller joints. The addition is a significant move for the clinic to enhance the availability of <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/apple-watch-upgrade-set-to-transform-wearables-by-2027\">cutting-edge technology</a></span> previously only available at their Horley partner clinic, which is focused on the treatment of the spine, hip, and knee.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Crawley Spinal Health MBST for small joints uses targeted magnetic fields to enhance the body\'s own healing responses. By accelerating cell regeneration of cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and bone, MBST promotes natural healing, significantly diminishing pain and inflammation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why is MBST special?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">MBST is a fully non-surgical treatment. In contrast to surgery or steroid injections, MBST treatments are not painful, do not involve recovery time, and are free of the side effects of traditional treatments. The treatment is already widely used among the best European athletes for speeding up the healing of injuries, but is now becoming more popular for general practice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We\'ve had wonderful outcomes for treating back, knee, and hip issues with MBST,\" said <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-mitchell-635a9153/\">Crawley Spinal Health Clinical Director Philip Mitchell</a></span>. \"Patients would occasionally ask if we could treat their hands or feet.

That\'s like the ultimate start.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Adjusting to an Evolving Healthcare Environment</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As of January 2025, 7.43 million individuals in the UK remain on the NHS waiting lists. While the figures are better, a great many patients are still waiting for long periods of time. This has created a mounting need for private treatment: in Q3 of 2024 alone, 223,000 admissions were made to private hospitals &mdash; a 1% rise on the same quarter of 2023.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With Crawley Spinal Health MBST for small joints, the clinic is riding this trend. The fact that it can offer surgery-free, drug-free treatment is appealing to a wide cross-section of individuals, from older adults with osteoarthritis to injured young athletes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Real-Life Outcomes Without Surgery</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The benefits of MBST are already apparent at Crawley Spinal Health. Mitchell had a number of success stories:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>&ldquo;We\'ve watched grandparents return to gardening, teenagers return to their school athletic teams, and people delay planned surgery because MBST provided them with the relief they were searching for. It\'s a game changer.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This clinic is now providing free consultations for the purpose of piloting whether MBST is suitable on a case-by-case basis with each patient. This entails the serious examination of joint status, general medical history, and individualized treatment planning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future of Joint Care Local </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the addition of Crawley Spinal Health MBST for small joints, patients in Crawley can now take advantage of one of Europe\'s most state-of-the-art treatments. It provides an alternative to the intrusive process of conventional medical procedures and an even quicker and safer way to recovery.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether you\'re coping with arthritis in your fingers, recovering from a foot injury, or simply tired of chronic joint pain, this new therapy could be just the relief you\'re seeking &mdash; right in the heart of Crawley.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-30', '00:41:10', 'crawley-mbst-for-hand-foot-pain-relief', 'article/visionaries-network-relieve-hand-foot-pain-with-crawley.webp', 'Relieve Hand &amp; Foot Pain with Crawley MBST for Small Joints', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-relieve-hand-foot-pain-with-crawley.webp', 4, 2025, 'MBST therapy, hand pain, foot pain, Crawley, small joints, arthritis, joint pain, non-invasive, therapy, regenerative treatment, pain relief, visionaries network, stiffness, physiotherapy, UK clinics', 'Discover how MBST therapy in Crawley offers effective, non-invasive relief for hand and foot pain in small joints.', 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

The company\'s reaction to the Microsoft Digital Markets Act response is being read far and wide as an attempt to lead by example and position itself as a reliable digital partner in Europe.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Massive Infrastructure Investment to Underpin Commitments</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Backing its talk with action, Microsoft announced it would grow its European <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/google-cloud-next-2025-unveils-smarter-ai-tools-and-chips\">cloud</a></span> infrastructure. Over the next two years, it will add 40% datacenter capacity in 16 countries in Europe. It will have over 200 datacenters in the region by 2027&mdash;a total investment of tens of billions of dollars.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This growth is not just a business strategy&mdash;it\'s also Microsoft\'s effort to be part of the European digital fabric. \"We are not only dedicated to building digital infrastructure for Europe, but to respecting the role that European laws play in governing our products and services,\" Smith emphasized.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Maintaining Sovereignty and Securing Information</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the highlights of the Microsoft Digital Markets Act response is a pledge of European digital sovereignty. Smith promised that if Microsoft is ever requested by a foreign government to temporarily suspend services in Europe, it will \"immediately and vigorously challenge such action.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To further promote confidence, Microsoft has launched a new \"European Digital Resilience Commitment.\" It will be legally binding and included in agreements with national governments and the European Commission, thus offering confidence and legal certainty.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Bridge, Not a Battleground </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Smith ended by saying, \"We are at a moment in time when business needs to be a bridge across the Atlantic.\" By doing so, he was framing Microsoft as a stabilizing presence in the face of increasing transatlantic tensions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Microsoft Digital Markets Act response can ultimately become an example for global technology businesses to operate in regulatory-heavy ecosystems without tension. By positioning itself in alignment with European values and legal systems, Microsoft is not just defending its business interests but also increasing its profile as a responsible technology leader.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-04-30', '23:39:30', 'microsoft-digital-markets-act-response-supports-eu-law-compliance', 'article/visionaries-network-microsoft-digital-markets-law-compliances.webp', 'Microsoft Digital Markets Act response supports EU law compliance', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-microsoft-digital-markets-law-compliances.webp', 4, 2025, 'Microsoft, Digital Markets Act, EU law, compliance, tech regulation, DMA, antitrust, visionaries network, Europe, big tech, competition law, digital regulation, Microsoft EU, DMA response, EU compliance', 'Microsoft affirms its support for the EU&#039;s Digital Markets Act, pledging full compliance with new digital competition and transparency regulations.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0);

The action would put Meta on par with other tech giants with paid access to premium-tier AI features and prioritizing user growth over short-term profits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The standalone <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/\">Meta AI app</a></span>, launched just a few days back, takes the company\'s <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/genai-research-delayed-over-industry-battle-slows-progress\">generative AI</a></span> assistant away from social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and onto its own turf. The app allows you to chat with the AI bot, generate images, and more. Already, it has signed up nearly a billion users worldwide&mdash;a healthy beginning for Meta\'s latest innovation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Paid Features in the Works</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/meta-smart-glasses-october-2025-new-features-and-launch-details\">Meta</a></span> so far has continued its AI tool for free, Zuckerberg indicated that there is more and more opportunity to offer further capabilities for a charge. \"There\'s an opportunity to offer a premium service to people who need to unlock more compute or more functionality,\" he said during the earnings call.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This Meta AI app premium tier would be directly in competition with similar products by OpenAI (ChatGPT Plus), Google (Gemini Advanced), and Microsoft (Copilot Pro). Premium tiers typically entail faster speed, early release of new features, and better models&mdash;something which can easily be replicated or even surpassed by Meta, given its massive user base.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>AI Investment Hits $72 Billion</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Zuckerberg further revealed that Meta doubled its spending on AI from the previously cited $65 billion to a staggering $72 billion. \"We now expect to spend up to $72 billion on AI,\" he declared, highlighting the strategic significance of artificial intelligence to the company\'s long-term vision.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even with a quarterly revenue of $42 billion, Meta does not seem to be in a hurry to monetize the AI app. Rather, Zuckerberg focused on the company\'s user adoption and engagement, saying, \"I expect that we\'re going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Advertisements and Product Recommendations Coming Soon</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to subscriptions, Meta is also set to roll out ads and product recommendations to the AI experience. But Zuckerberg made clear that monetization would roll out later. \"Before we\'re really ready to start building out the business,\" he said, Meta would like to optimize the user experience and develop its AI infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This user-centric approach sets Meta apart from others, who have been quick to roll out premium models. By holding off on monetizing right away, Meta is attempting to build a more solid, loyal user base before introducing a premium-level Meta AI app.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why This Matters</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The introduction of a Meta AI app premium tier has the ability to significantly change the AI assistant industry. Having nearly a billion users already on board, Meta\'s foray into the paid AI space will have an impact on consumer behavior as well as the strategies of competing platforms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Furthermore, the app\'s integration into Meta\'s broader ecosystem&mdash;spanning social media platforms to virtual and augmented reality&mdash;gives it a unique edge. With generative AI as the focus of digital experiences, having a capable assistant whose origin is in Meta\'s infrastructure might be the difference between a seamless and highly personalized user experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No official launch date has been released, but it appears that shortly Meta will be launching a paid version of its AI app. With a $72 billion injection and an enormous user base, Meta AI app premium level will likely be the foundation of the firm\'s new AI strategy. In the meantime, Meta is content to play the long game&mdash;focusing on scale, engagement, and customer satisfaction rather than opening the monetization faucet.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-02', '23:24:48', 'meta-ai-app-premium-tier-launches-new-revenue-stream', 'article/visionaries-network-meta-ai-app-premium-tier-unveiled.webp', 'Meta AI App Premium Tier Unveiled as New Revenue Stream Opportunity', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-meta-ai-app-premium-tier-unveiled.webp', 5, 2025, 'Meta AI, premium tier, AI app, new revenue, monetization, Meta platform, AI tools, subscription model, tech innovation, app upgrade, Meta services, artificial intelligence, visionaries network, AI monetization, digital services', 'Meta unveils a premium tier for its AI app, introducing new monetization opportunities through advanced features and subscription-based services.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

In a blog post that appeared on their site, the game developers informed that the next installment of the Grand Theft Auto series won\'t be available in 2025 as first intended. Grand Theft Auto VI will instead appear on May 26, 2026.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The title was revealed following months of rising rumors and silence on the part of the developers. \"We are sorry that this is later than you hoped,\" Rockstar wrote. \"The interest and anticipation for a new Grand Theft Auto has been humbling for our entire team. We appreciate your patience and your support as we work to finish the game.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rockstar continued to explain that the delay is needed to ensure that the game meets the extremely high standards that its predecessors have set. \"With every game that we have released, the goal has always been to try to surpass your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,\" they added.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Disappointment to Fans, But Not Surprising</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The fact GTA 6 release delayed to 2026 will be disappointing to many hardcore fans who have been holding on for more than a decade now that GTA V was released in 2013. The initial teaser of GTA VI was released in December 2023 and went on to become one of the fastest game trailers in <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.rockstargames.com/\">gaming</a></span> history, accumulating more than 250 million views in a matter of weeks. Nevertheless, the absence of follow-up content had already been creating rumors of delays from insiders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The teaser included a revisit to Vice City, the Rockstar fictionalized Miami. It also included a new playable avatar, Lucia, who is the first female protagonist of the series. Lucia is seen getting involved in all kinds of criminal ventures with her supposed partner, Jason, for an action-filled and dramatic plot.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Protagonists, Larger World</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The game will have two playable protagonists, Lucia and Jason, and will have a suspenseful storyline with heists, betrayal, and frenzied gameplay typical of Grand Theft Auto. Other characters like Stefani, a prison counselor, and a Joker-inspired antagonist figure have leaked and appeared on forum posts. The other characters rumored to appear in the game are Wyman, Dre, Kai, Billy, Sam, and Zach.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rockstar is said to be creating the largest open-world map in the company\'s history with dynamic weather, AI, and even changing neighborhoods over time. Insiders said that the production of the game is ambitious and resource-heavy, and that could be the reason why GTA 6 release delayed to 2026 became inevitable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While it\'s never pleasant to wait longer for a game you\'re excited about, Rockstar\'s history is that patience does pay off. Both GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 were delayed and became blockbusters.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If history is any indicator, Grand Theft Auto VI might just revolutionize the open-world formula when it finally releases in 2026. All the fans can do for now is wish that the expanded timeline means an even bigger game. And with the GTA 6 release delayed to 2026 made official, it\'s evident Rockstar is completely dedicated to creating the most groundbreaking Grand Theft Auto game ever.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-02', '23:39:21', 'gta-6-release-delayed-to-2026-as-rockstar-confirms-new-date', 'article/visionaries-network-gta-6-release-delayed-to-2026-as-rockstar.webp', 'GTA 6 Release Delayed to 2026, Rockstar Confirms', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-gta-6-release-delayed-to-2026-as-rockstar.webp', 5, 2025, 'GTA 6, Rockstar Games, release delay, 2026 launch, Grand Theft Auto, video game news, gaming update, GTA 6 release date, game delay, visionaries network, PS5, Xbox Series X, gaming industry, Rockstar update, new GTA', 'Rockstar Games officially delays GTA 6 release to 2026, confirming the new launch timeline for the highly anticipated open-world title.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

The new therapy, which is new to the marketplace, is used for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) that has received a number of previous therapies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The ISB 2001 FDA fast track designation is one of IGI\'s major milestones, as it is creating next-generation multispecific antibody therapeutics in oncology. The product is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial, in which initial data have shown encouraging evidence of safety and efficacy in patients who have already undergone at least three lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why is ISB 2001 so Special?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">ISB 2001 is a trispecific antibody that has been engineered to activate T cells in cancer targeting. It binds to BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and CD3 on T cells, enabling more effective tumor targeting. This method could potentially minimize the toxicity that is normally experienced in cancer therapy since it targets cancer cell markers without harming normal cells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">IGI announced that the dose-escalation phase of its Phase 1 trial has been completed and data were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2024. The results revealed a high overall response rate (ORR) and durable responses in heavily pretreated patients. Complete results will be presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why the Fast Track Matters </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The ISB 2001 FDA fast track designation is more than just a designation&mdash;it\'s a key that opens the doors to faster drug development and review by the FDA. Fast track drugs have more frequent interactions with the FDA, rolling submissions, and potentially priority review if certain thresholds are met. These benefits are designed to shave time off the process of bringing new therapies to patients, especially when current options are limited.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-konto/\">Dr. Cyril Konto, IGI President and CEO</a></span>, emphasized the pressing need for new treatments:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Most patients with multiple myeloma have already tried approved treatments and still have progression. Our trispecific candidate was designed to address these unmet needs, especially for patients who have already had CAR T-cell or first-gen bispecific treatment.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">ISB 2001 had already been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in July 2023, further reinforcing its potential to be a key new therapy for a rare and difficult-to-treat cancer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Boost to Glenmark Pharma</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The news also reflected positively on the stock performance of <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/glenmark-launches-vancomycin-hydrochloride-for-injection-usp\">Glenmark</a></span>. On Monday, the stock went up by 1.79%, closing at â‚¹1,400.30. The market appears to consider IGI\'s advancement as a pointer to Glenmark becoming a serious contender in next-generation oncology solutions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">IGI, a clinical-stage biotech company, is now gaining the spotlight for its work on creating multispecific T-cell engagers, a form of therapy widely considered by experts as the future of cancer immunotherapy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the ISB 2001 FDA fast track designation in hand, Glenmark and IGI are at the forefront of leading-edge oncology treatments.

Neuralink brain chip for speech impairment is awarded the official Breakthrough Device Designation by the&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a></span>, which means that it can be reviewed by the regulator on an accelerated basis and followed up with human trials.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This chip is intended to help patients with profound loss of speech due to neurological illnesses like ALS, stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. These ailments strike at the body\'s power to speak despite brain function remaining healthy&mdash;a limitation <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuralink/\">Neuralink</a></span> is now trying to undo.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a series of X (formerly Twitter) posts, Neuralink revealed that the new device will \"help restore communication for individuals with severe speech impairment.\" The innovation is a follow-up to the company\'s previous success with Blindsight, another vision-restoring implant that has already been tried in a human subject.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Era of Communications Technologies</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Neuralink brain chip for speech impairment is a significant step towards enabling those who have lost speech to speak once again.

Smith, whose speech capacity was lost to ALS, have seemingly been assisted by Neuralink\'s early technology. Smith described his experience on X, detailing how a robot inserted the threads of the device into his brain with great caution to avoid damaging blood vessels. Some of his skull was replaced to make room for the implant, illustrating the intricacy and precision involved.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With approval by the FDA for this breakthrough, Neuralink is now going ahead with human trials. The firm is recruiting actively from its Patient Registry, including individuals left without speech through neurological disease or trauma.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The implications of the Neuralink brain chip for speech disability extend far beyond the mere act of communication. It is a future in which people suffering from devastating disease are able to reclaim not only their voice but also a measure of independence and dignity. Through the backing of the FDA and endorsement by a high-profile entrepreneur like Musk, Neuralink is leading the charge in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the company moves closer to mass deployment, the world waits with bated breath&mdash;hopeful and eager to see how this erstwhile science fiction idea is rapidly becoming a reality that has the power to change lives.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-06', '17:10:52', 'neuralink-brain-chip-for-speech-impairment-gets-fda-nod', 'article/visionaries-network-neuralink-brain-chip-for-speech-impairment.webp', 'Neuralink Brain Chip for Speech Impairment Gets FDA Nod', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-neuralink-brain-chip-for-speech-impairment.webp', 5, 2025, 'Neuralink, brain chip, FDA approval, speech impairment, brain-computer interface, BCI, Elon Musk, neurotechnology, medical device, speech therapy, neural implant, visionaries network, healthcare tech, communication aid, neuroscience', 'Neuralink&rsquo;s brain chip receives FDA approval to help restore communication in people with severe speech impairments.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

The teaser implies a product that integrates cutting-edge AI with regular web browsing needs&mdash;streamlining the way users find, revisit, and interact with content on the web.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What is the Perplexity Comet Browser?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Characterized as an \"agentic search browser,\" the Perplexity Comet browser is designed to provide functionality way beyond current browsers. The word \"agentic\" was used to characterize AI systems that could perform tasks on their own, in a sequence of steps. Agentic systems can take context into account, respond in anticipation, and learn about users\' preferences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Think of Comet as more than a browser&mdash;your personal digital internet assistant. It will not just be waiting idly for your clicks; it will help you along the way, remember what you were doing, and provide you with information relevant to you based on what it finds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Key Features (so far)</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though no official feature list has been announced, TechRadar reports that the browser will help users conduct web research, with close integration with <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/google-and-samsung-to-launch-xr-glasses-in-2026-with-smart-features\">Google</a></span> services and live activity monitoring. These features will enable the browser to behave more intelligently on the basis of your web activity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There was a promo clip (briefly live before it was taken down) demonstrating how the Comet can reopen previously opened tabs with natural language.

Microsoft has been busily adding Copilot features into Edge, with AI-powered tab management, text summarization, and voice. Google will add its own AI enhancements to Chrome at its Google I/O conference later this month.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But what makes the Perplexity Comet browser stand out is its agentic design philosophy&mdash;where the browser is an active agent, not a passive tool. This agentic design may make it particularly useful for researchers, knowledge workers, and anyone who has to contend with multiple tasks online.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The launch of the Perplexity Comet browser will soon be a major milestone in the mainstreaming of AI into everyday web surfing.

From grill to plate, it all happens within a record time of 27 seconds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Say hello to Robot Chefs: Flexpicker and YuMi</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A clip on their own Instagram page has already made the rounds. It shows a fresh-off-the-grill patty dropping onto a bun and sliding down a conveyor belt with a scannable QR code. That\'s where the first robot, Flexpicker, takes over. Flexpicker scans the code and picks the toppings: lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and a dollop of their secret sauce &ndash; all in rapid-fire succession.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After the toppings are positioned, the second robot, YuMi, adds the finishing touches, constructs the burger, wraps it, and positions it in the serving station. The whole process appears straight out of a science fiction film, but it\'s all too real -- and already serving dozens of customers a day.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Concept Behind the Burger Bots</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The concept for this cutting-edge dining model was conceived by entrepreneur Elizabeth Truong, who wanted a smarter, quicker, and more efficient model of food service. As Truong describes, the restaurant is merely the start of what may be a significant paradigm shift in the way we approach fast food. Truong thinks automation will become common in the not-too-distant future, not only in back-of-house food preparation but in front-of-house as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the next five years, most restaurants will have some form of robotic automation, Truong said in a statement quoted by ABB. \"It\'s no longer a novelty &ndash; it\'s becoming a necessity.\".</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Game-Changer for the Food Industry</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The most significant advantage, she maintains, is cost management and consistency. Robots don\'t tire, don\'t call in sick, and deliver the same quality every time. For restaurant operators, it means better forecasting, better inventory management, and a more efficient operation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Public Reactions Are Varied</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, reactions on the internet have been varied. Most are shocked and willing to give burgers cooked by robots a go, but some are concerned about what this does to jobs in the food industry. \"This is brilliant technology, but also sort of frightening. Are we replacing everyone now?\" said one. Others replied in curiosity, tagging friends and intending to visit the robot burger restaurant in California just to see what all the fuss was about.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Is This the Future of Fast Food?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Excited or anxious, it\'s difficult to resist the allure of a made-to-order burger quicker than you can shout \"extra cheese.\" For San Jose and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/ginkgo-bioworks-gene-editing-transforming-biotech-beyond-silicon-valley\">Silicon Valley</a></span> diners, the robot burger restaurant in California is not just somewhere to visit &ndash; it could be a preview of things to come in fast food.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, the next time you crave a burger and are in California, skip the standard drive-thru and head to Burger Bots. You never know, you may be served by the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-07', '22:53:51', 'robot-burger-restaurant-in-california-serves-meals-in-27-seconds', 'article/visionaries-network-robot-burger-restaurant-in-california.webp', 'Robot Burger Restaurant in California Serves Meals in 27 Seconds', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-robot-burger-restaurant-in-california.webp', 5, 2025, 'robot burger, California restaurant, fast food tech, automated dining, AI kitchen, robot chef, 27 seconds, visionaries network, smart restaurant, food automation, robot fast food, high-tech dining, burger robot, futuristic food, robot kitchen', 'A robot-run burger restaurant in California is revolutionizing fast food by serving hot, fresh meals in just 27 seconds using AI-powered automation.', 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),
(175, '', 'India Strikes Back: Operation Sindoor 2025 Explained', 'India Strikes Back: Operation Sindoor Full Details 2025', 'Voice', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, in which 26 civilians &mdash; tourists and a Nepali national among them &mdash; were killed, India launched a bold military operation named Operation Sindoor. As people search for Operation Sindoor full details 2025, it\'s interesting to note that this was not just an exercise in power &mdash; it was a message.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On May 7, India conducted one of its most substantial counterterror attacks on record. Operation Sindoor, a surgical military action across the Line of Control, hit nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation, carried out as a reaction to the horrific Pahalgam terror attack, was quick, precise, and strategically advanced.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For those looking for Operation Sindoor complete details 2025, this was not merely a symbolic reaction. It was a national declaration &mdash; that India will not accept cross-border terrorism or be reluctant to hit its roots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Operation Sindoor Was Necessary</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The provocation came in the shape of the April 22 Pahalgam attack, in which 26 civilians, tourists, and a Nepali national were killed by terrorists who were reportedly trained in Pakistan. It was not the first such incursion &mdash; but this time, India made it the last.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Backed by advanced technology and guided intelligence, Operation Sindoor was launched with SCALP cruise missiles and Hammer smart bombs. The strike was between 1:05 a.m. and 1:30 a.m., and it was aimed at high-value militant training camps. As per Operation Sindoor full details 2025, the Indian Air Force ensured that there were no civilian fatalities and that Pakistani military assets were not targeted &mdash; a definite signal that India\'s problem is not with peace but with terror.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Pakistan\'s Reaction Reveals the Truth</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While India\'s action was one of precision, Pakistan\'s response was anything but. Mortar rounds from the other side of the LoC killed nine Jammu and Kashmir civilians and wounded many more. This futile gesture is indicative of the chronic issue: terror and denial are bedfellows in Islamabad\'s policy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rather than respond to why established terror groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba function so openly on its territory, Pakistan opted to deflect and amplify. This reaction only serves to justify the validity of Operation Sindoor full details 2025, demonstrating India had no other choice remaining on the diplomatic table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Chapter in India\'s Security Strategy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">India\'s national security policy is being perceived to change visibly. No longer confined to reactive diplomacy, India is adopting proactive deterrence. Operation Sindoor is a reflection of that change &mdash; balancing restraint with firm action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Where others feared escalation, India went out of its way to avoid civilian sites and Pakistani military bases. The single-minded intention was to disrupt terror infrastructure. Along the way, the operation has set a new standard for what a responsible, modern-day counterstrike would look like.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Across the globe, the reaction has been calibrated. Some countries urged restraint, but no one condemned India\'s right to defend its citizens. That implicit support speaks volumes. The world is finally waking up to India\'s long-standing battle against state-sponsored terror.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next After Operation Sindoor?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Operation Sindoor dealt a telling blow on the militant camps, the war is far from being won. Now India has to focus on:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Ongoing international pressure on Pakistan by means like FATF</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Enhancing domestic counterterror intelligence</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Aiding border communities that have been shelled</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&bull; Being diplomatically flexible to manage future escalations</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All those who are looking for Operation Sindoor full details 2025 need to realize that Operation Sindoor is not a response alone &mdash; it\'s a template of how India is going to respond in the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion: A Line Has Been Drawn</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Operation Sindoor is a landmark in the war against terror, which India is waging. It\'s not war, but it\'s a message that India\'s patience with violence has an end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This was a courageous, just, and calculated move &mdash; one overdue. And as more and more information about Operation Sindoor in 2025 emerges, one thing is certain: India has redefined the rules of engagement, and the world is taking notice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-07', '23:19:48', 'india-strikes-back-operation-sindoor-full-details-2025', 'article/visionaries-network-india-strikes-back-operation-sindoor.webp', 'India Strikes Back: Operation Sindoor Full Details 2025', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-india-strikes-back-operation-sindoor.webp', 5, 2025, 'India, Operation Sindoor, 2025 strike, military operation, Indian Army, defense, retaliation, war, visionaries network, national defense, India news, cross-border strike, strategic move, armed forces, Sindoor mission', 'Get full details on India&rsquo;s bold 2025 military response&mdash;Operation Sindoor, a strategic strike showcasing national defense strength and precision action.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

With RuneHero\'s closed beta live and featuring a massive $10,000 prize pool, and MaH beginning season 10, blockchain games are attracting the attention of both crypto and mainstream gamers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The much-awaited RuneHero beta prize event was live on May 4 and will continue until May 24, 2025. Built on the Immutable blockchain platform, RuneHero is an action RPG of Diablo\'s genre that unites the excitement of dungeon raids with NFT rewards and real-world economic incentives.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>RuneHero Closed Beta Is Live</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">RuneHero is a top-down action MMO RPG featuring action-packed combat, rich character customization, and a fully on-chain economy. The closed beta phase is inviting players to jump into a fantasy world of monsters, magic, and loot&mdash;to battle for the lucrative RuneHero beta prize.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unlike most RPGs, RuneHero lets you go your own way through a loose multi-class system. You can start off as a knight who uses a sword and turn into a battle mage who can cast fireballs. This freedom of playstyle provides massive replay value, especially with the extra motivation of in-game rewards.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The beta is already downloadable on Windows, and initial player reviews speak of its seamless combat system, intelligent skill leveling, and unobtrusive blockchain integration. Players can buy and sell in-game NFTs&mdash;such as weapons, armor, and characters&mdash;via the integrated auction house. It\'s not a game; it\'s a Web3 economy playable as a game.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With $10,000 offered as prize, the RuneHero beta prize has been the biggest anticipated spectacle this year in 2025 crypto <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/gta-6-release-delayed-to-2026-as-rockstar-confirms-new-date\">gaming</a></span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>MaH Season 10: \"Gold Justice\" Brings New Heroes and Hype</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While RuneHero dominates the RPG world, Mighty Action Heroes (MaH) still dominates the shooter world. The mobile battle royale game developed by Mighty Bear Games has just rolled out its Season 10 update titled \"Gold Justice.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This new season introduces two new explosive heroes, new powers, and high-risk gameplay that\'s creating ripples among both Web2 and Web3 audiences. MaH offers 20-player arena-style battles where the last one standing is the winner&mdash;and sometimes, crypto prizes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since its release in July 2023, MaH has had regular content drops every one to two months, with a dedicated player base and consistent gameplay loop dynamic. What sets it apart in the oversaturated shooter market is its multi-platform release, with releases on mobile, browser, and Telegram&mdash;with varying levels of Web3 functionality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>GOAT Gaming Telegram Bot Enters 330K User Base</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Behind the success of MaH is GOAT Gaming, a new Web3 gaming platform that is steadily becoming a Telegram behemoth. With over 330,000 monthly players that engage with its Telegram gaming bot, GOAT Gaming is creating a niche for low-friction, mobile-driven crypto games.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its portfolio features offbeat hits such as Kitty Solitaire, Waifu Clash, and Crypto Crawler, all built with in-game mechanics. This expansion has not gone unnoticed&mdash;GOAT Gaming raised millions in funding earlier this year from TON Ventures and other top players in the blockchain industry.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Their placement on Telegram provides them with an advantage, with users in a position to play right away without having to download heavy apps or navigate complicated wallet setups. This accessibility model is one of the key drivers of their rapid adoption.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As blockchain gaming matures, the RuneHero beta award and MaH\'s milestone tenth season show that Web3 games are no longer niche experiments&mdash;they\'re mainstreaming.

(179, '', 'How Digital Fashion Avatars Change Brand Marketing', 'How Digital Fashion Avatars Are Changing Brand Marketing', 'brand management digital marketing and business', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/hottest-summer-outfit-ideas-2025-to-shop-now\">fashion</a></span> and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/gr-digital-marketing-opens-new-agency-for-online-growth\">marketing</a></span> world is evolving at the speed of lightning&mdash;and leading the charge are digital influencers and digital solutions that marry technology and imagination. At the top of the most impactful trends here is the emergence of digital fashion avatars, computer-generated characters that brands use to promote products, engage with consumers, and make content creation easier.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These virtual characters assume a variety of forms. Totally computer-generated models like <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.cut-the-saas.com/ai/the-ai-behind-virtual-influencer-lil-miquela\">Lil Miquela</a></span> and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.virtualhumans.org/human/shudu\">Shudu</a></span> are purely virtual, interacting with fans through manipulated social media posts and brand endorsements. Others, such as Hatsune Miku, combine digital animation with human elements, such as voiceovers or motion capture. Whatever their form, these virtual personas have emerged as powerful marketing tools, particularly among Gen Z consumers who spend more time online than any other generation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Real People, Virtual Faces</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The international influencer marketing industry is booming, with its market size in 2024 being over US$24 billion and projected to expand to US$32 billion in 2025. A large part of the expansion is due to the adoption of AI-driven marketing solutions, including virtual influencers and digital fashion avatars, especially in Asia where technological development is fast and widespread.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Europe and the United States, fashion giants are also catching up. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., for instance, has collaborated with AI modeling companies to create digital avatars for their campaigns. Fast-fashion chain H&amp;M has also recently launched digital clones&mdash;AI-created copies of actual models&mdash;to sell their clothing lines. These avatars provide brands with flexibility, cost savings, and a scalable method of creating high-quality images for various channels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future of Digital Twins</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another trend gaining speed is the deployment of digital twins&mdash;computer duplicates of actual people who serve as substitutes in fashion magazines and internet commercials. Virtual influencers are unique in that they don\'t appear on social media or have histories. They are strictly for imagery purposes. Mango, for example, employed AI-generated models in a teen girls\' campaign to demonstrate the ability of AI in unifying fashion and technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While these technologies provide evident operational benefits&mdash;e.g., quicker production and customized content&mdash;they also raise perpetual ethical issues. Critics ask if computer models will displace human talent, e.g., photographers, stylists, and live models. Others worry about consent, image rights, and the authenticity of AI content.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Balancing Innovation with Responsibility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the most significant dangers that brands take when using digital fashion avatars is that they put consumer trust at risk. Should the public learn that a seemingly genuine person within a campaign is, in fact, completely AI-generated, then the brand\'s integrity is compromised&mdash;especially if this was not clearly made evident. Honesty, then, is essential. Audiences are respectful of honesty, and brands must signpost digital personas obviously to ensure they do not compromise their integrity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And then, naturally, there\'s the problem of representation. AI technology, as much as it can create diverse images, can quite easily mirror biases if it is not well-designed. An online avatar that is inclusive-looking in design but created without diverse input will nevertheless be short in representing fully.

(181, '', 'Federal Automation Tool to Reshape U.S. Workforce', 'Federal Workforce Automation Tool Set to Reshape U.S. Jobs', 'it and software', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A controversial new software tool is being implemented stealthily across U.S. government agencies with a single purpose: speed federal firings. Supported by&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.doge.gov/\">Elon Musk\'s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a></span>, the Workforce Reshaping Tool is a web-based replacement for the Pentagon\'s old AutoRIF program. It\'s designed to speed what was formerly a time-consuming, spreadsheet-based process&mdash;a swift, algorithmic solution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Behind it all is a broader trend toward federal workforce automation, a notion rapidly shifting from theory to reality. Supporters claim it\'s about modernization and cost savings. Critics worry it\'s about pinching&mdash;and on human beings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Layoffs Already Underway</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since President <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/micron-technology-adds-surcharge-to-offset-trump-tariffs\">Donald Trump</a></span> returned to office in January, nearly 260,000 federal workers have departed from their positions due to buyouts, early departure, or outright firing, according to a Reuters tally. The transition, however, has not been smooth. Dozens of employees were erroneously fired and then rehired, which points to loopholes in the present manual procedure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the new tool becomes a reality, drastic cuts are expected to rise. Organizations such as the Department of Veterans Affairs will be eliminating tens of thousands of positions, and the Internal Revenue Service has indicated plans to reduce its staff by 40%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Workforce Reshaping Tool: A Deeper Insight</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Originally named AutoRIF (Reduction in Force), the program was developed by the Pentagon more than 25 years ago to search employee records and identify layoff targets based on seniority, performance, and veteran status. But it was slow to use and prone to errors. The new version, designed by OPM developers for the use of Musk\'s DOGE, is cloud-based and supports real-time collaboration among HR staff. Agencies need not manually enter individual data points but can bulk upload databases for faster analysis. This reduces the time it takes to carry out a mass layoff by orders of magnitude.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its proponents see the tool as a required step in federal government workforce automation that will make the government more responsive and flexible during periods of agency reorganization or budget stringency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Problems of Speed and Equity</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But not everyone is so sure. Public sector unions and lawyers fear that making redundancies automatic will lead to arbitrary, if not downright discriminatory, results. \"If bad assumptions are built into the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/aveva-leads-shift-to-knowledge-as-a-service-platform-model\">software</a></span>, those assumptions can scale up quickly,\" said <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/donald-moynihan-9b160115/\">Don Moynihan of the Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan</a></span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The software also comes as there are legal battles, with a number of lawsuits brought to oppose recent agency reductions. All agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have already experienced substantial staffing cuts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite all these controversies, the rollout of the Workforce Reshaping Tool signals the end of federal workforce automation as a future possibility&mdash;it\'s now a reality. And while Elon Musk steps back from DOGE to focus on his private business, OPM will now spearhead the rollout of the tool to agencies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"mso-ansi-language: EN-US;\">&nbsp;</span></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-10', '01:15:23', 'federal-workforce-automation-tool-set-to-reshape-u-s--jobs', 'article/visionaries-network-federal-workforce-automation.webp', 'Federal Workforce Automation Tool Set to Reshape U.S. Jobs', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-federal-workforce-automation.webp', 5, 2025, 'automation, federal workforce, AI tools, job automation, government tech, U.S. jobs, digital transformation, visionaries network, labor shift, technology adoption, workforce change, AI in government, federal jobs, automation trends, job future', 'A new federal automation tool aims to transform U.S. jobs by streamlining processes, increasing efficiency, and reshaping the future of the public workforce.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

As per a ComputerBase report (via PC Gamer), the two firms will release an Arm-based laptop chip at the forthcoming expo, and news of the same is already causing ripples throughout the tech community.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rumor focuses on the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/nvidia-texas-factory-to-build-ai-chips-amid-tariff-shift\">Nvidia</a></span> MediaTek N1 SoC, a fresh system-on-chip that will introduce Blackwell GPU performance and Arm CPU efficiency to thin, high-performance laptops. This may be the turning point for the Windows on Arm ecosystem, which has yet to catch up with the brute performance of Apple\'s silicon in the laptop market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What We Know So Far About the Nvidia MediaTek N1 SoC</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2024/10/trident-iot-solutions\">chip</a></span> is reportedly a miniaturization of the GB10 Superchip &mdash; which was earlier demonstrated in Nvidia\'s Project DIGITS AI supercomputer (now known as DGX Spark). While the initial GB10 was meant for high-end AI workloads and servers, the new one seeks to balance power and portability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Early reports show that the Nvidia MediaTek N1 SoC will have 8 to 12 CPU cores, much fewer than the 20-core version the whole GB10 is. It may cut down memory support to 16GB or 32GB from 128GB on its desktop counterpart. But the specs may be more than sufficient for gaming, streaming, and content creation tasks on the go.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Benchmark leaks on Geekbench show promising scores, with the chip reaching 3.9GHz, a single-core score of 2,960, and a multicore score of 10,682. They are on par with performance chips in the latest generation but Apple\'s M4 Max is still a bit more integrated and efficient.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why It\'s a Big Deal for PC Gaming</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Windows on Arm has gone a long, long way recently, especially thanks to Qualcomm\'s Snapdragon X Elite, but gaming has always lagged behind with GPU issues and app support. That\'s where Nvidia\'s intervention comes into picture.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Nvidia MediaTek N1 SoC is said to include 50-series RTX parts such as 5th-gen Tensor Cores and 4th-gen Ray Tracing Cores. This could finally bring real-time ray tracing, DLSS, and high-definition gaming to Arm-based laptops, a huge leap from previous Windows on Arm implementations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gaming laptops powered by this chip may provide improved battery life, thinner and lighter form factors, and still be able to play graphically demanding games like Cyberpunk 2077 or Doom: The Dark Ages. That would put the playing field on par with Apple\'s own efforts using its M-series chips, as games like Resident Evil Village and Death Stranding are already natively supported on macOS.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Highlight of Computex 2025?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although nothing is actually on the table yet, all indications are pointing towards a major Computex 2025 announcement. With both Nvidia and MediaTek delivering keynotes, unless things change drastically, we should expect to see the N1 chip officially announced &mdash; perhaps with some early demos of prototype laptops or dev kits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is also speculation that this chip will come with Microsoft support in the form of Windows 12 optimizations, further optimizing app performance and native compatibility for gaming and productivity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the tech community gearing up for Computex, the leaked release of the Nvidia MediaTek N1 SoC has already set tongues a-wagging among PC enthusiasts, developers, and gamers. If the chip lives up to its promise, it would mean a paradigm shift in the laptop industry &mdash; one where serious gaming no longer depends on legacy x86 platforms.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-13', '22:31:24', 'nvidia-mediatek-n1-soc-could-redefine-gaming-laptops', 'article/visionaries-network-nvidia-mediatek-n1-soc-could-redefine-gaming.webp', 'Nvidia MediaTek N1 SoC Could Redefine Gaming Laptops', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-nvidia-mediatek-n1-soc-could-redefine-gaming.webp', 5, 2025, 'Nvidia, MediaTek, N1 SoC, gaming laptops, visionaries network, ARM, mobile gaming, AI, RTX, SoC, power efficiency, portable gaming, gaming performance, next-gen laptops, thermal design', 'Discover how the Nvidia MediaTek N1 SoC could revolutionize gaming laptops with enhanced performance, AI features, and power efficiency.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(185, NULL, 'Zoox Robotaxi to Launch in 2025 with California Facility', 'Zoox Robotaxi Set for 2025 Launch with New California Facility', 'iot-and-robotics', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Amazon\'s self-driving car unit Zoox is going into high gear as it readies to introduce its first U.S. commercial robotaxi services. Next year, the company will open a new factory in California\'s Bay Area, according to the Financial Times. The new capacity will massively boost production levels and enable Zoox\'s larger vision for self-driving city mobility.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now based in a smaller Fremont building, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://zoox.com/\">Zoox</a></span> is poised to move beyond pilot projects into actual service. With operating and financial support from <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/amazon-retail-chief-stresses-balance-between-cost-cutting-and-innovation\">Amazon</a></span>, the company is well-positioned as one of the leading players in the crowded autonomous space.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Purpose-Built Vehicles Specifically for Autonomy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unlike other driverless car manufacturers that modify current models, Zoox manufactures cars from the ground up. It is a square, symmetrical vehicle with no steering wheel and pedals. Face-to-face, passengers ride inside a spacious cabin &mdash; a configuration intended for driverless transit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This unique car design is all part of Zoox\'s vision to create a new type of ride-hailing experience. Co-founder of Zoox Jesse Levinson told FT in an interview that the company is preparing \"to make hundreds and then thousands\" of cars, ramping up from the two dozen units that are being tested in six U.S. cities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Zoox Robotaxi to Launch in Las Vegas and San Francisco</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The much-anticipated Zoox robotaxi service will debut in Las Vegas later this autumn, followed by San Francisco. Both cities provide high-density urban settings best for driverless transportation testing and rollout. The growth hub will facilitate these rollouts, also acting as an assembly base, fleet maintenance, and software support facility.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By launching in two large metropolitan areas, Zoox will establish public trust and accrue valuable performance information. The initial markets will pave the way for national rollout, introducing self-driving mobility to additional U.S. cities in the near term.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>New Regulatory Ecosystem Facilitates AV Development </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Zoox\'s growth comes at a time of greater leeway in the U.S. from federal regulators towards autonomous technology. These are recent government measures such as exemptions from specific safety requirements as well as relaxed regulations on accident reporting. Such relaxing of regulations would facilitate the deployment of robotaxi fleets at a faster pace.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, safety is a concern. Zoox, and companies like Waymo and Cruise, have been questioned by federal regulators looking into the reliability and performance of autonomous vehicles. It will be crucial to navigate this complex regulatory environment as the industry continues to evolve.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Amazon\'s Investment Gives Zoox Strategic Edge</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Amazon\'s purchase of Zoox in 2020 gave the start-up a significant fillip &mdash; not just financially, but operationally. Speculation is rife that in addition to ride-hailing, Zoox\'s platform can be used for autonomous delivery of packages, possibly supplementing Amazon\'s vast e-commerce network.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What sets Zoox apart from AV competitors is its vertically integrated strategy. Instead of selling its cars, the company will keep its own fleet of Zoox robotaxis. This end-to-end control lets Zoox be in charge of each phase of the passenger experience, from maintenance of the cars to in-app ride bookings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><strong>No Drivers in a Future World? </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Zoox robotaxi service is a groundbreaking step toward a world in which ride-hailing doesn\'t require a human driver behind the wheel. If its first public rollouts in 2025 go well, Zoox can be a trailblazer in a sector that\'s likely to transform transport in the coming decade.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With deep pockets, creative product design, and regulatory tailwinds, Zoox is creating not just a car &mdash; but an end-to-end autonomous mobility platform. Next year will be a test case, and everybody is waiting to see how the company executes its ambitious plan.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-13', '23:57:37', 'zoox-robotaxi-set-for-2025-launch-with-new-california-facility', 'article/visionaries-network-zoox-robotaxi-set-for-2025-launch.webp', 'Zoox Robotaxi Set for 2025 Launch with New California Facility', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-zoox-robotaxi-set-for-2025-launch.webp', 5, 2025, 'Zoox, robotaxi, autonomous vehicles, 2025 launch, California, self-driving car, Amazon, mobility, visionaries network, electric vehicle, smart transport, Zoox facility, future mobility, ride-hailing, tech innovation', 'Zoox plans to launch its autonomous robotaxi service in 2025, supported by a new state-of-the-art facility in California.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

From serviced apartments and luxury suites to dining and meeting function spaces, all of the hotel\'s amenities, minus one, will be offered at reduced prices to Bybit Card holders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;This collaboration is an indication of the way that the future of lifestyle and travel is going,\" says <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/giacomopuntel/\">Giacomo Puntel, General Manager of Grand Millennium Hotel Dubai</a></span>. \"We\'re thrilled to make luxury accessible to the crypto-aware traveler.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why This Crypto Hotel Transaction Matters</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The campaign is not just a publicity stunt. It\'s evidence of an even bigger, fast-growing trend in crypto-friendly travel. As digital currencies become increasingly mainstream, hotels, airlines, and retail stores are seeking ways to attract tech-savvy customers who wish to pay with cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bybit, with its fast-expanding crypto exchange and cutting-edge card program, already has over 1.7 million registered users globally. Bybit cardholders are able to pay merchants globally using their crypto by converting it to fiat at the point of purchase. With this Dubai hotel promotion, the company is again demonstrating its dedication to making it rewarding and convenient to pay with crypto.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Bybit is committed to bringing crypto payments into everyday expenditure and everyday luxury for our users,\" said Helen Liu, Partner and COO of Bybit. \"Dubai is among the world\'s most crypto-embracing cities.

One of a handful but increasing number of high-end properties welcoming crypto payments as the new norm, the hotel isn\'t just a convenient option for tech-savvy travelers, but it puts Dubai on the world map of global leaders for adopting cryptocurrency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Dubai was in the headlines this year with its foray into crypto as an accepted currency for public service charges, and Emarat pioneered MENA with the acceptance of digital currency payments for fuel.

(187, NULL, 'Valve Deckard Leak Fuels New VR Headset Rumors', 'Valve Deckard Leak Sparks Fresh VR Headset Release Rumors', 'ai vr and automation', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The virtual reality space is on fire in 2025. Apple, Meta, Sony, and HTC have all released new headsets, and interest is growing fast. But&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/\">Valve</a></span> VR headset rumors are the topic of interest these days regarding something a bit more mysterious&mdash;and maybe life-altering. It\'s known as the Valve Deckard by its internal codename.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First hinted at back in 2021 via leaked patents and backdoor code, the fact that Valve has a next-gen headset has been an open secret. Now, fresh rumors indicate we might not need to wait until late 2025 to get it. In a report by <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/\">TechRadar</a></span> and information posted by trusted VR leaker, SadlyItsBradley, Valve has just started importing certain parts&mdash;specifically facial interfaces&mdash;for VR headsets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is a major indicator. Facial interfaces are among the last things to be put together inside a VR headset, and as such, production is going full-tilt. Though there is no promise that the headset will be on store shelves tomorrow, it may imply an earlier-than-expected release date. Late 2024 or early 2025 now seems to be a genuine prospect.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Player in the Standalone VR Market?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you\'ve already experienced the Valve Index, you\'ll appreciate the company\'s focus on <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/vr-for-alzheimers-detection-is-a-breakthrough-in-early-diagnosis\">premium VR</a></span>. But the Index required a powerful PC and external base stations&mdash;immersive, but clunky. With the Deckard project, Valve seems to be targeting a different demographic: wireless, standalone freedom.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Recent reports on the Steam backend confirm it. There are references to experimental ARM container tools and a Linux SteamVR Link driver from developers. These suggest that Valve is preparing its software for a headset that doesn\'t need to be plugged into a PC&mdash;putting it firmly in competition with the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If so, Valve Deckard would place PC-grade VR in a single, cordless package. For players, it would provide butter-smooth graphics, HD screens, and the entire SteamVR library at their fingertips without a desktop environment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Power of Silence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In spite of all the rumors and leaks, Valve has still not officially confirmed the existence of the device. The tongue-in-cheek site IsValveDeckardOut.com still has a huge \"NO\" on the screen. It\'s a reference to Valve\'s notorious habit of remaining quiet until a product is 100% complete&mdash;a habit that fans have nicknamed \"Valve Time.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All that aside, most signs point to something very real being just around the corner. Code names, controller references (apparently dubbed \"Roy\" in line with Blade Runner motifs), and now hardware imports&mdash;these are getting to be very telling signs that Valve Deckard is more than just a piece of paper.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Should You Wait?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you\'re looking to buy a new VR headset in 2025, this is the million-dollar question. While headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and PSVR2 are already out, Deckard might be the one with the performance jump, especially for those who want the wireless version without compromise. Until Valve comments officially, it\'s all rumor. But whatever is certain: the latest updates on Valve VR headsets are more exciting than ever, and if rumors come true, the next great leap in VR is around the corner sooner than ever before.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-14', '23:27:09', 'valve-deckard-leak-sparks-fresh-vr-headset-release-rumors', 'article/visionaries-network-valve-deckard-leak-sparks-fresh-vr-head.webp', 'Valve Deckard Leak Sparks Fresh VR Headset Release Rumors', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-valve-deckard-leak-sparks-fresh-vr-head.webp', 5, 2025, 'visionaries network, Deckard, VR headset, VR rumors, gaming, virtual reality, Valve leak, SteamVR, Deckard specs, headset release, VR tech, next-gen VR, gaming news, Valve Deckard 2025, Valve rumors', 'A fresh leak about Valve&#039;s Deckard headset has sparked new rumors about an upcoming next-gen VR device in development.

This one-platform technology is designed to help surgeons who perform fat reduction, skin tightening, and other body contouring treatments, combining a number of technologies into one advanced device.<br><br>The heart of AYON is Apyx\'s proprietary Renuvion technology, which uses helium plasma and radiofrequency energy to tighten and contract loose skin. The system also includes ultrasound-assisted liposuction and electrocoagulation, enabling the removal of excess tissue and contouring to be done more effectively. With these features, AYON is poised to meet the growing needs of patients who undergo significant body transformation.<br><br>The Apyx body contouring system will be aimed towards a targeted commercial launch in the second half of 2025, in which the company will be making the system available to targeted aesthetic and plastic surgeons.<br><br>&ldquo;The aesthetics market is anticipating a significant surge in body contouring treatments next year,\" <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-goodwin-1b294b3b/\">Apyx Medical CEO Charlie Goodwin</a></span> stated. &ldquo;Over 15 million patients already taking GLP-1RA anti-obesity medications are seeing rapid fat loss, and most are now looking for effective treatments for tightening loose, sagging skin.

Though the patients lose a considerable amount of weight within a few months, they are left with loose skin&mdash;particularly on the tummy, arms, and thighs. This has created a new need for skin tightening and body contouring procedures.<br><br>Apyx Medical\'s AYON system appears to be set to meet this emerging market.

These conditions will allow for a better setup to create materials that are difficult or even impossible to create on Earth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These materials produced in space hold the promise to bring crucial breakthroughs to markets like semiconductors, quantum computing, clean energy, and defense, Space Forge asserts. The company states that its process can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 75% for some infrastructure applications&mdash;particularly energy-efficient equipment-intensive data centers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A representative for the company said, \"Space Forge is enabling us to make things that can\'t be made on Earth. These missions will demonstrate a scalable, reusable platform for making these innovations real.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Growing Global Footprint</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The UK <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../startups\">startup</a></span>\'s ambitions do not stop at home. Its US affiliate, Space Forge Inc., is preparing to help America\'s cause under the CHIPS and Science Act to resuscitate the US chip industry. By offering a space-based alternative to traditional chip manufacturing, the company is poised to reduce reliance on politically exposed regions like Taiwan.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-flemming-3767533/\">Michelle Flemming, President of Space Forge Inc.,</a></span> added, &ldquo;We are committed to building an end-to-end semiconductor capability in the United States that combines Earth-based talent with orbital innovation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This cross-continental strategy places Space Forge at the center of the UK and US tech resilience national plans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Backed by Big Climate Investors </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The funding round was led by World Fund, a climate-tech venture capital firm focused on decarbonizing industries. General Partner Daria Saharova referred to the risk of relying too much on specialized geographic areas to manufacture semiconductors and described Space Forge\'s solution as timely and essential.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This show of confidence from climate-focused investors also reflects the company\'s potential to contribute to the fulfillment of clean tech and sustainability targets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Platform for Future Reuse</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another unique feature of ForgeStar satellites is that they are returnable. Instead of becoming space junk or burning up during re-entry into the atmosphere, the satellites can come back to Earth, get refurbished, and be re-launched, which is a reusable option for orbital manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The company will launch its initial test mission in 2025, which will prove the ability of the satellite to produce and recover safely valuable materials.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Last Outlook </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the tech race heating up all over the world and the increasing need for high-tech materials, Space Forge is leading the revolution to alter manufacturing off the planet. Space Forge is not only helping in the decarbonization of industry but also revolutionizing the future of semiconductor and quantum technologies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With robust funding, a robust mission statement, and international reach, Space Forge is firmly establishing itself as a Space manufacturing start-up UK to watch out for.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-17', '22:58:47', 'space-manufacturing-start-up-uk-space-forge-raises-30m', 'article/visionaries-network-space-manufacturing-start-up-uk-space.webp', 'Space Manufacturing Start-Up UK Space Forge Raises $30M', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-space-manufacturing-start-up-uk-space.webp', 5, 2025, 'Space Forge, UK startup, space manufacturing, funding, $30M, investment, satellite tech, visionaries network, orbital production, advanced materials, microgravity, aerospace, venture capital, new space, UK tech', 'UK-based space manufacturing start-up Space Forge secures $30M to expand orbital production and advance space-based material innovation.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Its UK subsidiary company Relonchem Ltd, has received marketing authorisation from the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UKMHRA) for Gabapentin oral solution (50 mg/ml), a commonly prescribed drug for pain caused by malfunctioning nerves and epilepsy. The oral liquid preparation is especially beneficial for patients suffering from swallowing difficulties with the usual tablets or capsules.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The news increased the optimism among investors, and the share of Marksans Pharma reached an intraday high of â‚¹243.65, higher by 2.3%. The stock was in the positive territory at 2:50 PM at â‚¹240.61, higher by almost 1% from the last close.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why the Approval Matters</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marksans Pharma Gabapentin UK approval is an important addition to the firm\'s global portfolio of central nervous system (CNS) medicines. Gabapentin is an important CNS drug for the treatment of long-term nerve conditions and is prescribed in substantial quantities in Europe and North America. The oral solution that has recently been approved in the UK simplifies treatment&mdash;particularly for elderly patients, pediatric patients, and those who have swallowing problems.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;This clearance further strengthens our CNS product offerings in the UK and reaffirms our commitment to providing high-quality, patient-centric solutions,\" stated <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshavardhan-panigrahi-1340b8137/\">Harshavardhan Panigrahi, Marksans Pharma Company Secretary</a></span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By targeting underserved patient groups and focusing on different dosage forms, Marksans Pharma is aggressively shifting towards expanding its therapeutic footprint globally.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Global Regulatory Momentum</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marksans Pharma Gabapentin UK approval follows a series of positive regulatory milestones for the company over the last few weeks. Marksans Pharma was approved in March by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia for the Verna, Goa plant. TGA approval will allow the plant to produce solid oral dosage forms&mdash;tablets and capsules&mdash;to serve the Australian market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The same month, UKMHRA also approved Relonchem Ltd\'s Baclofen 10 mg tablets, a muscle relaxant for the treatment of symptoms of spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. The back-to-back approvals reflect Marksans Pharma\'s growing credibility and reliability in meeting highly stringent regulatory standards of developed economies like the UK and Australia.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Market Response and Outlook</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The news was greeted well by investors, and Marksans Pharma was among the leading pharma stocks on May 15. While other stocks such as Kaya (+20%), Banco Products (+20%), and Premier Explosives (+18.31%) also caught the momentum, Marksans\' rise was rooted in good fundamental news.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marksans Pharma Gabapentin UK approval further solidifies its UK market platform and positions it in the broader European CNS <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/alembic-pharmaceuticals-wins-usfda-approval-for-pantoprazole-injection\">pharmaceutical market</a></span>, a multi-billion dollar opportunity. With regulatory platforms in the UK, Australia, and other developed markets, the company is well-positioned to continue its international expansion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Takeaway&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Marksans Pharma Gabapentin UK approval is a strategic achievement that demonstrates the firm\'s capability to offer quality, cost-effective medication tailored to patient needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With an expanding CNS portfolio and increasing regulatory success in international markets, Marksans Pharma is positioning itself as a patient-focused, world-compliant pharma firm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For those interested in exposure to growth pharma companies with international growth opportunities and compliance with regulations, Marksans Pharma is worth considering.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-19', '23:37:33', 'marksans-pharma-gabapentin-uk-approval-boosts-shares-2', 'article/visionariesnetwork-marksans-pharma-gabapentine-uk-approved.webp', 'Marksans Pharma Gabapentin UK Approval Boosts Shares 2%', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-marksans-pharma-gabapentine-uk-approved.webp', 5, 2025, 'Marksans Pharma, Gabapentin, UK approval, pharma news, drug approval, healthcare, UK medicine, pharmaceutical industry, Gabapentin UK, pharma stocks, drug launch, visionaries network', 'Marksans Pharma shares rose 2% after UK approval of its Gabapentin capsules, boosting investor confidence in the company&rsquo;s international growth prospects.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

ORI Capital China biotech fund will invest in pioneering healthcare start-ups, namely those that are using <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/meta-ai-app-premium-tier-launches-new-revenue-stream\">artificial intelligence (AI)</a></span> in drug development and discovery.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Founded by Goldman Sachs veteran <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/simone-song-b0752a1b1/\">Simone Song</a></span> in 2015, ORI Capital has become a biotech investor in leading biotech companies globally. Through this third and largest fund, the firm is now focused on \"investing heavily\" in Chinese biotech &mdash; an endeavor Song describes as being in harmony with the country\'s \"DeepSeek moment,\" an allusion to the historic AI breakthroughs this year in China.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We believe China\'s biotech industry is at a turning point,\" Song said. \"It\'s no longer a question of catching up &mdash; Chinese companies are starting to innovate, and we\'d like to be a part of it.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Betting on the AI Advantage in Medicine</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The ORI Capital China biotech fund will utilize the company\'s proprietary AI-driven platform, Orizon, to identify potential start-ups in China. Orizon is designed to sift through massive amounts of data &mdash; clinical trial data, scientific literature, IP landscapes, and regulatory documents &mdash; and identify early-stage biotech firms with scalable, differentiated technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"AI allows us to make more intelligent, faster investment choices,\" Song said. \"It removes bias and allows us to observe individual opportunities in a crowded universe.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">China\'s biotech market has become more competitive since numerous firms are targeting the same disease or biologic marker. ORI believes its AI-driven screening process gives it a better advantage in finding firms with true breakthrough potential.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why Now? The timing of the ORI Capital China biotech fund is not coincidental. Six of the world\'s leading ten pharmaceutical licensing transactions in the first quarter of 2025 alone involved Chinese-produced drugs, including GeneQuantum and Hengrui, according to biopharma data provider PharmCube.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Song referred to the quick success of firms such as Legend Biotech, which in 2017 inked a US$350 million licensing agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson\'s Janssen Pharmaceuticals for its CAR-T treatment. \"We would like to have more success stories like Legend,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Additionally, China\'s vast talent pool, strong research environment, and high-capacity manufacturing base are fertile ground for biotech innovation. The country\'s growing population of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs &mdash; with an enabling regulatory environment &mdash; is setting China up for next-generation leaders in global health.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Beyond Borders</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While ORI Capital China biotech fund will focus heavily on domestic opportunities, Song said it will also explore cross-border co-ventures and foreign commercialization platforms. The goal is to invest in those companies that can compete &mdash; and win &mdash; on the global stage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Past success stories, including New York-listed California-based CG Oncology, sponsored by ORI, show the potential of the firm to support companies to grow and access significant markets. The new fund seeks to replicate and scale that impact in China. With $350 million of committed capital and a playbook that marries AI with deep biotech expertise, ORI Capital is emerging as an advocate of the next generation of Chinese healthcare innovation.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-19', '23:43:28', 'ori-capital-china-biotech-fund-targets-350m-for-ai-driven-growth', 'article/visionries-network-ori-capital-china-biotech-fund-targets.webp', 'ORI Capital China Biotech Fund Targets $350M for AI-Driven Growth', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionries-network-ori-capital-china-biotech-fund-targets.webp', 5, 2025, 'ORI Capital, China biotech, AI biotech, biotech fund, AI healthcare, venture capital, biotech growth, artificial intelligence, pharma AI, biotech startups, drug discovery, life sciences, biotech innovation, visionaries network', 'ORI Capital plans to raise $350M for a new biotech fund, aiming to boost AI-driven innovation across China&#039;s life sciences and healthcare sectors.', 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS) security partnership with <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/\">Palo Alto Networks Inc.</a></span> (PANW) is to launch a new security-first connectivity solution, \"T-Mobile SASE, with Palo Alto Networks.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This innovative solution unites T-Mobile\'s cutting-edge 5G network infrastructure with Palo Alto Networks\' highly praised Prisma SASE 5G, zero-trust, cloud-native security solution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The mission? Seamless, streamlined, and highly secure connectivity for enterprise business and public sector clients across the country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The new service will be hosted by T-Mobile\'s 5G Advanced standalone network&mdash;the first-of-its-kind in the country. The proprietary network is the backbone of the service, which provides higher security performance and a quicker user experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This strategic launch is an important step in the transformation of 5G,\" said <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mishkadehghan/\">Mishka Dehghan, SVP of Strategy, Product &amp; Solutions Engineering, T-Mobile Business Group.</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;By adding Palo Alto Networks\' proven SASE capabilities into our 5G Standalone network, we&rsquo;re delivering built-in security from the ground up, empowering our business and government customers with a seamless solution that protects their data across every endpoint.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This integrated solution is also timely as it comes in the midst of an unexpected spike in cyber attacks, with businesses largely depending on mobile workforces, cloud applications, and smart devices. The new T-Mobile SASE platform is aiming to minimize threats by protecting data on various endpoints&mdash;laptops, smartphones, IoT devices, or 5G routers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Makes This Partnership Unique?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>1. T-SIMsecure</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">T-Mobile\'s T-SIMsecure is a hardware-based SIM authentication feature enabling secure, self-service device authentication. Compared to traditional software-based security, this SIM-based approach minimizes IT management complexity, especially for devices like IoT sensors and 5G routers that cannot support complete SASE applications. It counts on identifiers like IMSI and IMEI to enable secure access from any endpoint.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Security Slice</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Security Slice constructs a virtualized network layer solely for dedicated traffic, segregating it from all other traffic for enhanced performance and data protection. Not only does this enhance speeds from legacy networks like LTE and Wi-Fi, but it also provides additional layers of privacy and control for end-users on enabled 5G devices.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Prisma SASE 5G from Palo Alto Networks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Prisma SASE has a Zero Trust strategy, where devices and users are continuously checking their identity and security posture prior to accessing high-sensitivity resources. This would reduce the threat of identity breaches and unauthorized access, especially in hybrid or decentralized work environments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The managed service should roll out later this summer, giving companies another reason to examine their cloud and mobile security infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why This Matters Today</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As boundaries between business and social networks remain porous, the demand for scalable, secure, and cloud-capable connectivity has never been more important. T-Mobile US, Inc.

The firm is now sitting on a staggering 7,800 BTC, worth over $807 million at the current price, making it one of the world\'s top ten listed firms with the largest holdings of Bitcoin.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This expansion is no coincidence. It is a bold, strategic bet on digital holdings, implying that Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings are not only a hedge&mdash;but a core financial tool. The company\'s aggressive maneuvers can change institutional investors in Asia\'s approach to crypto.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Strategy Built on Bitcoin</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Metaplanet\'s rocket-like path in the cryptocurrency universe is in a highly focused strategy of Bitcoin purchases. During May 2025 alone, the firm made two headline-grabbing purchases&mdash;first purchasing 1,241 Bitcoins and then another 1,004 Bitcoins. These purchases worth more than 15.2 billion yen, were made at an average price of 15.13 million yen per Bitcoin.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The goal? To overtake Galaxy Digital, which has 8,101 BTC in its vault, and become a member of the exclusive club of the top nine largest publicly disclosed Bitcoin holders. Should the pace keep up, that milestone could be reached sooner than later.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Smart Tracking, High Performance</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s not simply a matter of investing in Bitcoin&mdash;Metaplanet is converting those holdings into concrete dividends. During Q4 2024, the company\'s Bitcoin holdings returned a staggering 309.8%. Q1 2025 added another 95.6%, and the second quarter is already at 47.8%. These returns indicate an extremely calculated investment model supported by excellent timing and strategic foresight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With in-house performance indicators like BTC Gain and BTC &yen; Gain, Metaplanet has close monitoring of its <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/bitcoin-price-after-trump-news-boosts-crypto-market-sentiment\">Bitcoin</a></span> positions. The company\'s proprietary approach has immediate adjustments and risk management in advance of market changes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Creative Financing Without Traditional Debt</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To capitalize on its successive purchases, Metaplanet is embracing a warrant-based financing strategy&mdash;a technique that bypasses traditional debt without compromising value for shareholders. By issuing successive structured warrants, the company gains access to capital without putting a substantial dent in shares.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This funding model provides room for maneuver in uncertain markets and guarantees that the firm can respond fast when Bitcoin falls or rises. It\'s a hybrid model that is appropriate for the dynamic character of crypto trading.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Asia\'s Crypto Attitude Shift</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Japan has traditionally been conservative in the realm of cryptocurrency. But Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings have set the pace, proving that Japanese companies can be as innovative&mdash;and as bold&mdash;as their Western counterparts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In fact, Metaplanet now holds more Bitcoin than El Salvador, the world\'s first country to legalize Bitcoin as legal tender. With its aim of one day holding 1% of the world\'s store of Bitcoin, the firm is creating new space in the region and disrupting traditional thinking of what is possible in Asian crypto markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Road Ahead </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Metaplanet\'s achievement is staggering, the crypto world is known to be volatile. Whether or not it can sustain the momentum and its sky-high returns remains to be seen.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But one thing is for sure: Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings are now part of the company\'s brand and strategy. By opening up more possibilities for what Japanese companies can accomplish in crypto, Metaplanet is becoming a model for local investment&mdash;and a power to be met with in the global digital asset space. Competitors and investors are taking notice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-21', '00:15:22', 'metaplanet-bitcoin-holdings-surge-past-800m-in-2025', 'article/visionaries-network-metaplanet-bitcoin-holdings-surge-past-8m.webp', 'Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Surge Past $800M in 2025', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-metaplanet-bitcoin-holdings-surge-past-8m.webp', 5, 2025, 'Metaplanet, Bitcoin, crypto, investment, visionaries, visionaries network, digital assets, blockchain, finance, portfolio, cryptocurrency, market, growth, strategy', 'Metaplanet&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings surge past $800 million in 2025, highlighting its aggressive crypto investment strategy and market confidence.', 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

That\'s right &mdash; when everybody else is still on Android 12 or 13, Volvo Android 15 update is already available in the wild to be rolled out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We will be in a position to respond fast in bringing new capabilities, new features, and new experiences to our customers,\" <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alwinbakkenes/\">Volvo global software engineering head Alwin Bakkenes</a></span> told Reuters in an interview. \"This actually gives us an early advantage in creating great customer experiences.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why It Matters</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Overall, the auto industry has lagged two full Android updates behind smartphones. That is, drivers have not been able to access the same smart features in their cars that they adore on their phones. This partnership aims to bridge that gap&mdash;and fast.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Through its role as a lead development partner, Volvo has a front-row seat to Google software innovation. More importantly, Google engineers will now validate new Android features in Volvo vehicles for real-time feedback and performance insights in actual driving scenarios.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"They will take the car, see how their product performs in real-world conditions&mdash;much sooner and much quicker,\" Bakkenes said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Gemini AI Takes to the Highway</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another major overhaul was announced at the Google I/O conference: Google\'s Gemini AI model will be integrated into Volvo cars soon. For the drivers, it will mean no more messing with touchscreens or scrolling through long lists of contacts to enter destinations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rather, you can say things such as:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Hey Gemini, locate my dentist appointment in my mail and take me there,\" or &ldquo;Create a shopping list for those ingredients from that dinner recipe my sister shared with me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Volvo\'s purpose, says Bakkenes, is a \"human-centric experience\" &mdash; one where technology enhances your experience without taking away from it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Android 15 Takes the Road First with Volvo</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Volvo Android 15 update will be offered in the EX90 SUV later this year, with other models to follow. That would put Volvo owners in the position of potentially having two years more advanced software than the competition &mdash; a huge advantage in the connected car market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While other firms will only be able to release Android 15 in 2027, Volvo drivers will already be enjoying it by the end of 2025.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is not about listening to music or using maps. Android 15 will improve everything from voice control to personalized infotainment systems, making driving smarter and safer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This move makes Volvo a clear technology pioneer in the automotive industry.

But now, a revolutionary, drug-free remedy is revolutionizing the treatment of migraines&mdash;especially among young people.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FDA-approved <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.nerivio.com/\">Nerivio REN wearable device</a></span>, previously only available to adults, is now approved for patients 12 and up. This drug-free device provides patients with hope who are unable to tolerate or do not respond to drugs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Instead of working chemically, the FDA-approved Nerivio REN wearable device harnesses Remote Electrical Neuromodulation (REN) to engage the body\'s own pain relief mechanism. It is worn on the upper arm and delivers soft electrical impulses that stimulate nerve fibers. This causes a response in the brain that leads to the release of natural painkillers such as serotonin and endorphins.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For Downingtown, Pennsylvania, working mom Alison Kerber, this technology was a game-changer. \"Dealing with chronic pain on a daily basis was really challenging, and I was consistently benched,\" she said. Traditional medications not only failed to keep her migraines in check&mdash;they caused severe side effects. Desperate for relief, she employed the FDA-approved Nerivio REN <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/how-an-ecg-smartwatch-is-revolutionizing-heart-health-among-young-adults\">wearable device</a></span>, and the effect was almost immediate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It doesn\'t harm and it doesn\'t use drugs,\" Kerber explained. \"I use my phone to operate the device. I\'m able to adjust the stimulus up or down until it\'s just right. It\'s regained control of my life.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-kling-newnam-29b48111a/\">Dr. Heidi Kling-Newnam, a nurse practitioner at Penn Medicine</a></span> who sees migraine patients, commented that the technology behind the device is elegant and potent. \"By simulating the sensation of pain&mdash;without actually causing injury&mdash;it causes the brain to release its own natural painkillers,\" she said. \"And because it\'s noninvasive and drug-free, the risk of serious side effects is extremely, extremely low.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Nerivio has 45 minutes of wear per session and may be worn at the beginning of an attack of a migraine or every other day as a prophylactic measure. It is therefore perfect for those with both episodic and chronic migraines. The new FDA approval for use in children makes it now available to teenagers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although some insurance companies are catching up on coverage, the out-of-pocket cost is roughly $90 per month. For Kerber, every cent is worth it. \"Being pain-free is worth every cent,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Medical professionals are excited about what that holds for the future of migraine therapy. While the device won\'t be effective for everyone, it has demonstrated enormous potential, particularly for people who are looking for something other than medication. And with no severe side effects that have been reported, it\'s becoming increasingly popular with patients and physicians alike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As more people become informed, the FDA-approved Nerivio REN wearable device can be a major part of the battle against migraines. To those families seeking safe, effective, and drug-free answers, it could be the answer they\'ve been waiting for. If you or a loved one are plagued by migraines&mdash;especially if meds haven\'t helped&mdash;the Nerivio wearable is worth investigating.

The transaction, announced Tuesday, lets Levi\'s double down on its core denim business and direct-to-consumer growth strategy while providing Authentic with a widely known casualwear brand to place alongside its growing roster.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Under the agreement, Authentic will acquire Dockers intellectual property, but Centric Brands will oversee day-to-day operations, including manufacturing and distribution. The arrangement is similar to Authentic\'s standard model, which is based on licensing and building brands in global markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Levi\'s has been considering selling Dockers since October 2024 in an effort to make its business more rational and to cut out internal brand competition. The Dockers brand, launched in 1986 as a fashionable alternative to jeans, had been a hit in the 1990s and early 2000s. But with changing <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/bio-based-fashion-manufacturing-startup-simplifyber-raises-12m\">fashion</a></span> and the resurgence of denim, khakis have been out of style in the United States.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellegass/\">Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass</a></span> underscored that the move is in line with the company\'s long-term goals. \"The Dockers transaction further aligns our portfolio to our strategic priorities&mdash;focusing on our direct-to-consumer-first approach, expanding our international footprint, and investing in women\'s and denim lifestyle offerings,\" Gass said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why did Levi\'s decide to sell</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the most recent quarter to March 2, Dockers contributed $67 million of revenue to Levi\'s. While not trivial, the brand was no longer a significant growth driver. Executives cited brand duplication too&mdash;both Levi\'s and Dockers were offering similar tops and bottoms, making it hard to differentiate brands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to this, Dockers was also hurting Levi\'s bottom line. By selling it to Authentic, Levi\'s can release capital and focus on more profitable segments, such as its core denim and growing athleisure brand, Beyond Yoga.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Noteworthy is the fact that the agreement also includes a performance aspect: Levi\'s can receive up to $391 million in future payments based on the performance of the Dockers brand in the hands of Authentic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Sees Global Expansion on The Horizon</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although khakis have gone out of style in the United States, Dockers remains popular outside the country. Authentic Brands plans to leverage an international network of licensing partners to restore and grow the Dockers brand globally. With more than 1,700 licensing partners, the company is already negotiating with proprietors in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Few brands have a category as fully in their ownership as Dockers does, yet with as much potential left in front of them,\" Authentic Brands Group President Matt Maddox stated. \"Its casualwear heritage will help it, but the real upside is repositioning the brand to a next generation.\".</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Authentic\'s portfolio features successful revamps of other popular brands such as Reebok, Forever 21, and Nautica. The firm is an expert at buying and licensing legacy brands that retain consumer relevance but require strategic repositioning.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Dockers Brand Sold&mdash;What It Means for Retail</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Dockers brand sold is reflecting a larger pattern within the fashion industry: narrowing portfolios to concentrate on high-margin core assets and to enable brand management companies to inject new life into heritage brands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Levi\'s, for example, is honing its concentration on direct-to-consumer sales and product innovation. Authentic, however, views Dockers as a growth driver in international casualwear.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is not just a simple sale&mdash;it\'s a sign of how large apparel companies are refocusing. With the Dockers brand sold, both Levi\'s and Authentic are betting on their strengths: Levi\'s on heritage denim and customer relationship, and Authentic on global reach and brand revitalizing expertise.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For fashion observers and retail investors alike, the Dockers deal will be worth observing because it will be a harbinger of a new trend in how established brands become relevant again in a fast-accelerating global economy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-22', '23:25:59', 'dockers-brand-sold-to-authentic-for-311m-in-levis-shakeup', 'article/visionaries-network-dockers-brand-sold-authentic-levis-shakeup.webp', 'Dockers Brand Sold to Authentic for $311M in Levi&rsquo;s Shakeup', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-dockers-brand-sold-authentic-levis-shakeup.webp', 5, 2025, 'Dockers, Authentic Brands, Levi&rsquo;s, brand sale, $311M deal, fashion news, apparel, visionaries network, brand shakeup, retail news, Levi Strauss, business deal, clothing, Dockers sale, fashion industry', 'Levi&rsquo;s sells Dockers to Authentic Brands for $311 million in a strategic shift to streamline its business.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(205, '', 'BYD Surpasses Tesla in Europe EV Sales &ndash; April 2025', 'BYD Beats Tesla in Europe April 2025 as EV Leader Shifts', 'ai vr and automation', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a surprise switch for the European electric vehicle (EV) market,&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.bydglobal.com/en/index.html\">BYD</a></span> beats Tesla in Europe April 2025, new figures from automotive market research firm JATO Dynamics say. Chinese automaker BYD (002594.SZ) had 7,231 <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/jeff-bezos-bets-on-affordable-electric-pickup-truck-maker\">battery-electric vehicles</a></span> (BEVs) registered in European markets in April, edging past Tesla (TSLA.O), which had 7,165.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is BYD\'s first time beating Tesla in Europe, a region long dominated by Elon Musk\'s EV brand. It is a first for not just BYD, but all Chinese automakers seeking to establish themselves in one of the world\'s most competitive car markets. \"This is a turning point for Europe\'s auto market,\" <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-munoz-carindustryanalysis/\">JATO Dynamics global analyst Felipe Munoz</a></span> said. \"Tesla has ruled the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began selling cars outside Norway and the Netherlands towards the end of 2022.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>BYD\'s meteoric rise</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the main reasons BYD beats Tesla in Europe April 2025 is the business\'s aggressive expansion plan and wide range of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Although April sales only account for BEVs, overall market share of BYD is growing strongly. One recent case of the firm\'s strategy is the BYD Dolphin Surf, introduced at a recent Berlin event: affordable, desirable, and well-equipped EVs for the European market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although the European Union charges electric vehicles made in China, their sales keep rising. Sales of Chinese electric vehicles grew 59% year-on-year in April compared to the same time last year, while sales of their European, Japanese, South Korean, and American counterparts grew 26%. The figures reflect the strength of Chinese manufacturers in the face of regulatory hurdles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aside from this, European BEV registrations in the region increased 28% in April 2024, showing sustained consumer appetite for electric mobility. Chinese automobile manufacturers, particularly BYD, are capitalizing on the same by offering value-for-money options compared to traditional Western manufacturers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Tesla\'s Fading Momentum</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Conversely, Tesla\'s European operations have been defined by a string of issues. The company posted a 13% drop in worldwide deliveries in Q1 2025, and the expectation here is for another year of reduced production. Although Elon Musk asserted that Tesla has recovered elsewhere in the world, the sales landscape in Europe does not match.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tesla troubles have several causes. The older model lineup of the company is falling behind newer models from rivals. In addition, production deficiencies from factory retooling to make the new Model Y have compromised supply. Potential customers are waiting for more affordable versions of the Model Y, which has led short-term sales to plummet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Elon Musk\'s politics have also set off protests and boycotts in Europe and the U.S., hurting Tesla\'s brand reputation in its most lucrative markets. In a consumer-facing business, these kinds of reputation blows can hurt sales in quantifiable ways.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Paradigm Shift in the Global EV Scenario</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">BYD beats Tesla in Europe April 2025 is more than a headline on the front page&mdash;it\'s a harbinger of a larger revolution in the global automobile industry. Chinese electric vehicle makers are no longer niche players; they\'re increasingly serious competitors with an increasingly significant presence in overseas markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With its sights fixed on long-term dominance, BYD is poised to become a global giant. Its success in Europe may be the start of a bigger phenomenon where Chinese automakers increasingly lead the way in driving innovation, design, and affordability in the EV space. Since competition is increasing, current players like Tesla must adapt quickly or fall even further behind&mdash;not just in Europe, but everywhere.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-23', '00:09:49', 'byd-beats-tesla-in-europe-april-2025-as-ev-leader-shifts', 'article/visionaries-network-byd-beats-tesla.webp', 'BYD Beats Tesla in Europe April 2025 as EV Leader Shifts', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-byd-beats-tesla.webp', 5, 2025, 'BYD, Tesla, EV sales, Europe, April 2025, electric vehicles, visionaries network, auto industry, clean energy, BYD vs Tesla, EV growth, European market, car sales, green tech, EV trends', 'BYD overtakes Tesla in European EV sales for April 2025, signaling a major shift in the electric vehicle market leadership.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(206, NULL, 'U.S. to End Penny Production by 2026, Treasury Confirms', 'Treasury Confirms End of Penny Production USA by 2026', 'banking and fintech', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The penny, which has been a staple of US currency since 1793, is finally at the end of its own long, winding road.&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/\">The US Treasury Department</a></span> formally announced the end of penny production USA in 2026. The announcement brings to an end over two centuries of the one-cent coin clinking in the country\'s cash registers, charity jars, and piggy banks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The move came after a directive by President Donald Trump to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier this year to halt minting the coins, calling them \"wasteful.\"<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/bitcoin-price-after-trump-news-boosts-crypto-market-sentiment\"> Trump</a></span>, in his letter, cited the rising expense and limited uses of pennies in the present cashless economy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It now takes 3.69 cents to produce a penny, nearly four times its face value, Treasury estimates. A decade ago, it took around 1.3 cents. It is the expense of keeping pennies in circulation that has led to annual losses, with the Treasury estimating a saving of $56 million in the first year when production is halted.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Coin No Longer Worth Its Price</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although beloved by some for sentimental reasons, the penny has long been a target of reform. Not only do detractors argue the coin is antiquated, they also contend that it is costly to the environment, constructed of zinc and copper&mdash;materials that are energy-intensive to extract and manufacture.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even Elon Musk, the billionaire, weighed in on the issue, using his unofficial Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) Twitter account on X to pinpoint the problem of penny inefficiency. His go-viral January post sparked widespread public debate about the problem.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Treasury confirmed that the last order of penny blanks has already been placed and that from this point, the United States Mint will only be producing pennies until they use them up.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Will Change? </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The end of penny production USA will compel companies to adjust by rounding prices to the nearest nickel. Although some consumers are concerned with minor price hikes resulting from rounding, economists say the impact will be negligible.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other countries that have followed suit&mdash;like Canada, which got rid of its penny in 2012&mdash;have had easy transitions with little impact on inflation. The United Kingdom itself has also not been manufacturing new 1p and 2p coins in recent years due to declining cash use.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even with the shift in logistics, the majority of economists see the transition as a step toward economic efficiency. \"It\'s symbolic, but it\'s necessary,\" says <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/willis-launches-fintech-insurance-solutions-with-fintech-plus\">financial</a></span> analyst Morgan Steele. \"We\'re phasing out a coin that\'s done its job in the economy now.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>End of an Era</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The penny\'s exit marks the end of an era in American life. To some, it\'s not merely a coin&mdash;it\'s a symbol of culture. From the Lincoln penny minted in 1909 to the common expression \"a penny for your thoughts,\" the lowly copper coin has a strong presence in American hearts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But as it goes digital and cash disappears, even the most sentimental rituals have to change. The end of penny production USA is not only a policy change&mdash;it\'s an indication of how money, business, and everyday life continue to change.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Collectors are already getting on the bandwagon. Demand for 2025 pennies&mdash;the final year of full minting&mdash;will increase as individuals desire a physical reminder of American history. So, if you do have a penny, maybe don\'t spend it. It will be worth more than lost forever.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-24', '00:24:13', 'treasury-confirms-end-of-penny-production-usa-by-2026', 'article/visionaries-network-tresury-confirms-enfd-of-penny-production.webp', 'Treasury Confirms End of Penny Production USA by 2026', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-tresury-confirms-enfd-of-penny-production.webp', 5, 2025, 'penny production, U.S. Treasury, coin phase-out, end of penny, U.S. currency, coin news, U.S. economy, visionaries network, coin value, currency update, federal reserve', 'The U.S. Treasury confirms penny production will cease by 2026, marking the end of an era in American coinage and currency cost-cutting efforts.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

Work on the construction will resume immediately, putting the U.S. offshore wind industry back on the move.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Half a Million Houses Powered by 2027</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Empire Wind project, which produces 810 megawatts of clean power, will supply about 500,000 homes once it is operational in 2027. The project is 30% finished. With the approvals now being in place, Equinor is now in position to go ahead with installation procedures within the offshore <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/indot-announces-u-s--31-construction-project-in-franklin\">construction</a></span> window in 2025.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersopedalequinor/\">Equinor CEO Anders Opedal</a></span> was thrilled and upbeat: \"We look forward to the opportunity to restart building Empire Wind, a project that demonstrates our commitment to producing energy while benefiting local economies and employment opportunities.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Project with National Footprint</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Leased initially in 2017 during the Trump presidency, the Empire Wind site lease was federally approved in 2023 by President Joe Biden. The project utilizes advanced Vestas wind turbines and features a multi-state supply chain with investments in New York, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, and South Carolina.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This project meets the energy objectives of New York and the U.S., said Molly Morris, Equinor Wind US President. \"Empire Wind provides supply chain investment in states across the nation.\".</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Financial Review and Policy Implications</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the month-long hiatus, Equinor will re-evaluate the financial feasibility of the project in Q2 2025. The company was spending about $50 million a week during the pause period to keep the project on hold for a potential restart&mdash;unaffordably so without resolution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rescission of the stop-work order has been met with welcome relief by the wider renewable energy sector. It has been seen as a strong message that the U.S. administration is committed to maintaining the integrity of fully approved energy projects.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This Empire Wind construction update 2025 also indicates more stability for long-term infrastructure investors, who were rattled by the abrupt stoppage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behind the Political Curtain</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Reuters reports that stop order removal may be included as part of a greater energy deal with New York State. The agreement can expedite the delayed Constitution natural gas pipeline&mdash;a planned project that was previously shelved due to environmental concerns&mdash;ahead of the election.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This political compromise demonstrates how convoluted and interdependent federal and state energy agendas are. As much as the Empire Wind restart is welcome news for renewables, it also points to more systemic strategic bargaining in America\'s evolving energy landscape.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Offshore Wind in the United States</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The United States currently has four operational offshore wind farms and four in development. Among them, Empire Wind is one of the largest. It\'s an experiment in how the nation balances renewable energy development with regulatory predictability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The latest Empire Wind construction update 2025 is comforting for the industry stakeholders. It shows that even in the face of looming threats of shifting politics and rising costs, offshore wind is the priority.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the stop-work order officially lifted and production back in progress, Equinor is again on target to meet its 2027 commercial operation goal. The firm will now be working closely with regulators and suppliers to minimize the impact of the delay.

The improvements include the hardening of substations, the installation of smart grid technology, and the upgrading of outage response systems in high-priority service territories like Texas and Indiana.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The goal is to offer uninterrupted power supply in times of severe weather, a demand on the rise as storm activity is being driven by climate change.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By taking these forceful actions, CenterPoint has demonstrated a strong commitment to customer service and infrastructure dependability&mdash;two drivers of investor confidence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Stock Jumps 8% Despite Market Headwinds</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CenterPoint Energy shares gained 8% over the last quarter, beating general market trends during volatility triggered by global trade tensions and the U.S. presidential election.

These advances are not just operational, but strategic, too, keeping the business competitive while being consistent with evolving energy regulations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This planning deserves a positive CenterPoint Energy stock forecast 2025, particularly with investors looking for companies with long-term vision and operational efficiency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Smart Choice During an Uncertain Market</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Utility stocks are gaining popularity as safe bets in the current uncertain market.

Cruise passengers in the nation rose 20% from 2019 to 2024 &mdash; a figure still on the increase.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As cruising becomes more popular as a vacation choice, specialist cover is increasing. Normal policies do not typically include cruise-type situations, so cruise travel insurance Australia is emerging as a holidaymaker\'s add-on.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Customer-Centric Innovation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/damien-arthur-9642aa5/\">Damien Arthur, Allianz Partners Australia Executive Head of Travel</a></span>, greeted the alliance with these words:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;As part of our continued commitment to product development and putting our customers at the heart of everything we do, our new alliance with Norwegian Cruise Line is a direct reflection of this. Our research has shown us that cruise holidaymakers are extremely likely to purchase travel insurance. We have now made it even easier for them to get cover more relevant to their needs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The change not only makes booking easier but also means that Australian cruise vacationers have a policy that is specific to their holiday &mdash; and not a one-size-fits-all policy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Cruise Travel Insurance Matters</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cruise travel insurance Australia is not a luxury &mdash; it\'s a precaution. Cruises involve special risks: vacationers are frequently carried a long distance from land-based medical care, port calls may be skipped, and disease on the high seas may result in expensive treatment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This product covers all of these risks, so travelers can relax. With this partnership, Allianz Partners and Norwegian Cruise Line are not selling a product &mdash; they\'re selling peace of mind.

The bold color scheme immortalizes a taste-adventure-filled chapter in a relationship that has been brewing since 2006.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Coffee, Clouds, and Celebration</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Boston debut was more than a paint job reveal. The guests had an all-out party with complimentary <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.dunkinathome.com/\">Dunkin\' coffee</a></span> for a month, co-branded limited-edition items, and close-up inspection of the JetBlue Dunkin coffee plane.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both Dunkin\' and JetBlue posted a behind-the-scenes video of the plane\'s makeover. Posted on social media, the video\'s caption read, \"Your favorite breakfast spot is doing planes now\"&mdash;and the fans went wild.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Facebook, individuals were expressing their humor and enthusiasm. \"I am ready to fly on it!\" said one of the thrilled travelers. Another one joked, \"How many Dunkin\' points is a flight?\" Even American Eagle could not help but have some fun with it, writing, \"Taking the phrase \'to new heights\' to another level.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Relationship That\'s Been Brewing for Years</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the new livery is fresh, the JetBlue-Dunkin\' partnership isn\'t. The airline first began serving Dunkin\'s Original Blend coffee onboard back in 2006. Five years later, Dunkin\' emerged as the official coffee partner of JetBlue, and passengers could count on their favorite cup of coffee every time they boarded a flight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This alliance has existed for almost two decades with JetBlue,\" JetBlue President Marty St. George stated. \"We\'re excited to mark it with a paint job as colorful and playful as the brands themselves. With our common Boston roots and our emphasis on customer happiness, the JetBlue Dunkin coffee airplane is a great convergence of two favorite brands.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Taking Brand Loyalty Sky-High</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aside from the bright colors and coffee advantages, the JetBlue Dunkin coffee airplane is a successful brand combination. With the union of two symbols of the American lifestyle&mdash;morning coffee and flying&mdash;the collaboration strikes the hearts of the supporters of the two brands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether you\'re taking a weekend getaway or a business flight, walking onto a plane with donuts and coffee can\'t help but put a smile on your face. Throw in the fact that your favorite coffee is on tap on the plane, and you\'ve got an airline experience that\'s truly over the top.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">JetBlue keeps pushing the boundaries with innovative marketing, and this latest step solidifies its position as a company that\'s innovative and customer-centric. Dunkin\' also reiterates that it\'s not just a coffee house&mdash;it\'s a cultural phenomenon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Last Sip </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The more passengers learn about this unique aircraft, the more the JetBlue Dunkin coffee plane will be a fan favorite&mdash;and a selfie destination at airports across the country. It\'s a bold, caffeinated reminder that sometimes the greatest journeys start with a good cup of coffee, even at cruising altitude. So, the next time you fly JetBlue, look around. You might just get the friendliest <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/space-manufacturing-start-up-uk-space-forge-raises-30m\">flight</a></span> in the sky.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-28', '11:26:02', 'jetblue-dunkin-coffee-plane-unveiled-with-bold-new-design', 'article/visionaries-network-jetblue-dunkin-coffee-plane-unveiled-with-new-bold-design.webp', 'JetBlue Dunkin Coffee Plane Unveiled with Bold New Design', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-jetblue-dunkin-coffee-plane-unveiled-with-new-bold-design.webp', 5, 2025, 'JetBlue, Dunkin, coffee plane, new livery, airline branding, aviation news, JetBlue design, travel, aircraft, visionaries network, visionaries, visionariy network', 'JetBlue reveals a new Dunkin-themed coffee plane featuring a bold design, celebrating their partnership and brand creativity.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

HBO recently released the Harry Potter HBO cast 2025, introducing new young talents to play Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the new web series retelling of J.K. Rowling\'s beloved books. The news, shared on Instagram, got the internet buzzing even as HBO took a strategic step back to disable comments on the post in an attempt to protect the new cast from early online criticism.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Golden Trio</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_McLaughlin\">Dominic McLaughlin</a></span> played the role of Harry Potter, taking over from Daniel Radcliffe. He is joined by Arabella Stanton as Hermione Granger and Alastair Stout as Ron Weasley. HBO did their casting under a themed announcement post:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Dear Mr. Potter, Miss Granger, and Mr. Weasley: We are pleased to inform you that you are accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over 30,000 hopefuls auditioned following HBO\'s casting call last year, making the final three\'s choice a huge moment. The young actors will bear the huge burden of the original films\' legacy as they take the story forward for a new generation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Veteran Stars Join the Ranks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Harry Potter HBO cast 2025 is not complete without the golden trio.

The action seems to be a defensive measure to protect the young actors from the crudeness of early internet criticism.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Social media responses had already shifted to other sites such as X (formerly Twitter). One of the commenters said, \"Wish the kids luck.

The showcase will present a handpicked set of eco-friendly video games 2025, with the aim of raising awareness regarding climate change, sustainability, and the power of play to build a better world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The tournament will be hosted live in front of an audience by renowned gaming journalist Will Freeman, a regular contributor to GamesIndustry.biz. It will feature innovative games that entertain and inform, created by leading studios like Amazon Games, Lockwood Publishing, Sharkmob, Team17, Netspeak Games, and Wicked Saints Studios.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Climate Action Through Gameplay</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">PlanetPlay\'s vision extends far beyond the promotion of green games. The company is committed to actually making a positive impact on the environment. The objective for this campaign is to raise $300,000 by June 30, 2025, to fund the planting of 50,000 trees in Timor-Leste, a country severely affected by deforestation. This reforestation project will be achieved through collaboration with WithOneSeed, a local non-profit dedicated to long-term land restoration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gaming groups, according to <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhea-loucas/\">PlanetPlay CEO Rhea Loucas</a></span>, have untapped potential for climate campaigning:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This is not an exhibition, it\'s an appeal.

He will be joined by Freeman to discuss how games can drive change on climate and encourage gamers to take concrete action in their own lives.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Livingstone is among four new ambassadors PlanetPlay welcomed last month, including actress Briana Evigan and Formula E world champion Pascal Wehrlein, who are equally passionate about sustainability and digital activism.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Players Are Making a Difference Already</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">PlanetPlay has recently released fresh findings from its Play2Act survey, which it conducted in collaboration with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). It\'s good news: nearly 50% of gamers indicated that they made sustainable changes&mdash;like decreasing electricity consumption or purchasing in-game items online&mdash;after playing climate-themed games.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These findings verify that climate-friendly video games 2025 are able to influence behavior and help players become part of the solution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Join the Green Gaming Movement </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The environmentally friendly video games 2025 exhibition is not just an event&mdash;it\'s a movement in the making.

The majority of Oklahoma adults began college with dreams, only to have life intervene in the way of work, family, or financial issues. But now, there is a second chance. The&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.reachhigher.org/\">Reach Higher initiative</a></span> is enabling adults to return to college and finish the degrees they put on hold.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This Oklahoma adult degree completion program is governed by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/alice-techs-ai-platform-raises-4-8m-to-personalize-learning\">Education</a></span> and was created to help adult students juggling more than one responsibility. With online classes, scholarships, and personalized counseling, it\'s having a real impact for people across the state.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What is the Reach Higher Program?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Reach Higher is a state degree completion program,\" says program manager Tisha Bradford. \"That\'s the advantage of it. You can be anywhere in the state. It\'s for adults who\'ve been to college but, for whatever reason, had to stop out. Now they\'d like to come back and complete that degree.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The program is geared towards the working adult. Regardless of whether you work full-time, have kids, or both, Reach Higher provides the support you need to go back to school on your schedule.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Designed for Real Life: Adapting Classes and Full Support</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Blending school with adult life is most likely the biggest challenge adults face in going back to school. Reach Higher confronts this challenge head-on by providing flexible class schedules&mdash;online, evening, and weekend classes that fit busy lifestyles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Each of the 27 Oklahoma schools participating in the program has a navigator. The navigators work with the students one one-on-one every step of the way, from signing up to graduation. \"They assist you from where to park on day one to where to park when you receive your diploma,\" Bradford explains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">They also help the students to apply for the Finish Line Scholarship, which provides grants to adult students seeking their degree.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beyond scholarships, navigators help students access other community resources&mdash;like childcare or transportation support&mdash;to help remove the practical barriers to returning to college.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Who is Eligible? </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The program is for adult learners who have previously attended some college credits but never graduated. The program provides both associate\'s and bachelor\'s degree levels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"To qualify, you simply need to visit one of the 27 Oklahoma schools that belong to it,\" adds Bradford. \"It\'s all on our website, including the schools, the programs they have, and the individual to contact for that wonderful navigator I described.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This Oklahoma adult degree completion program is not about attending school again&mdash;it\'s about creating a path to a better tomorrow. If you\'re in need of a career change, looking for job stability, or completing a lifelong aspiration, Reach Higher can help.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How to Get Started</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Interested adults can visit ReachHigherOK.org, the program\'s website. There, you can search schools, find scholarships, and even fill out a free student interest form. The form, once filled out and submitted, will go directly to Bradford and the navigator at your school of choice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I contact them in a matter of seconds and say, \'Congratulations! I saw you. You\'re off to school. Let\'s get this done,&rsquo; \" Bradford says. \"And then I take them through the next steps.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A Degree Within Reach Oklahoma is making education goals more accessible than ever before, even if the journey started years earlier. With personalized counseling, financial aid, and the convenience of online courses, the Oklahoma adult degree completion program is opening doors for thousands who thought college was out of reach.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So, if you\'re one of the many Oklahomans with some college credit but no degree&mdash;listen up: it\'s never too late to complete what you began.

The big-box retailer experienced earnings per share up 13% to $4.28, above the predicted $4.24. Revenue was up 8% to $63.2 billion, above the estimated $63.13 billion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The strong results are despite comparable store sales barely beating expectations. Same-store sales overall rose 5.7%, falling short of analyst estimates by a hair at 6%. Adjusted for gas prices, the number rose a healthy 8%, reflecting Costco\'s ability to drive core retail growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>U.S. and Canada Post Mixed Performance</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Domestically, Costco is strong. U.S. stores saw same-store sales rise 6.6%, while Canadian stores saw less impressive 2.9% growth. U.S. same-store sales gains in April were 5.2%, down from 9.2% in January. Excluding the sale of gas, comps rose 7.1% in April, reflecting ongoing strength in core merchandise categories.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">April sales were worth $19.8 billion, up 7% from last year. March sales were bigger still at 8.6%. Everyone is watching the trend closely to see how it will do in the second half of the year, given the macroeconomic pressures on consumer wallets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Gold Bar Craze and Payment Flexibility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In one of the more unusual headlines, Costco has imposed a buy restriction on gold bars&mdash;two per buyer every 24 hours. The change, added to the website in mid-May, comes as demand remains high and gold prices swing. Wells Fargo estimates Costco is selling $100 million to $200 million worth of gold bars each month since the initiative began in summer 2023.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Costco is also becoming more convenient to shop at. On May 14, the company announced a deal with Affirm to provide installment payments for big online purchases from $500 to $17,500. This is aimed at both small business owners and cash-strapped families, making bulk shopping more affordable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreover, the company boosted its quarterly dividend to $1.30 a share from $1.16, reiterating its shareholder-friendly strategy for the second quarter running.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Costco Stock Near Buy Zone</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">COST shares remained flat after the earnings announcement, hovering around its buy zone. The <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/centerpoint-energy-stock-forecast-2025-upgrades-boost-outlook\">stock</a></span> had already broken out above a cup-with-handle base at $1,018, and the buy zone was as high as $1,068.90.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The stock has been supported at its 21-day exponential moving average and is at its 10-day line. With the broader S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in a confirmed power trend, they are waiting for the breakout to continue.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The average true range (ATR) of COST stock is 1.76%, which represents stable price action as compared to volatile stocks. This would be a more stable growth scenario for growth investors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Analyst Take: Costco Stock Forecast 2025</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Upcoming days will witness analysts keeping their fingers crossed when it comes to the Costco stock forecast 2025. Bernstein has just reaffirmed its \"outperform\" rating of Costco on the basis of the company\'s pricing strength and nimble merchandise purchasing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although the company reduced its price target from $1,153 to $1,148, it justified that any drop would be a good entry point because shares are currently \"priced to perfection\" at 53x earnings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the firm\'s steady performance, dividend growth, and services like in-store payment flexibility, the Costco stock forecast 2025 shows growth continuation. Investors anticipate earnings growth to be robust as the company rides on customer loyalty and operational effectiveness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In summary, as much as same-store sales growth has come down, Costco is still a retail behemoth. For long-term growth investors with moderate volatility, the Costco stock forecast 2025 still holds great prospects.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-05-30', '23:00:18', 'costco-stock-forecast-2025-what-investors-should-expect', 'article/visionaries-network-costco-stock-forecast-2025-what-invest.webp', 'Costco Stock Forecast 2025: What Investors Should Expect', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-costco-stock-forecast-2025-what-invest.webp', 5, 2025, 'Costco stock, COST forecast, 2025 stock prediction, stock market, retail stocks, Costco earnings, investment forecast, NASDAQ COST, stock growth, dividends, Costco analysis, visionaries network, Costco shares, investor guide, stock performance', 'Explore Costco stock forecast for 2025, including expert predictions, earnings outlook, and key trends investors should watch before making investment decisions.', 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

The international superstar has finally bought the master recordings of her first six albums for herself, owning her entire catalog outright for the first time in her career.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Swift publicly declared on May 30, 2025, in an open letter, the emotional significance of finally owning <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2024/06/suno-and-udio-sued\">music</a></span> she gave her heart to from the start. \"All of the music I\'ve ever made&hellip; belongs to me,\" she said. \"After 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away, it\'s mine.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Long Road to Ownership</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Taylor Swift music ownership controversy began in 2019 when her original label, Big Machine Records, sold her master rights to Scooter Braun. Swift was surprised at the move, as she went on to reveal she was not offered any genuine opportunity to buy back her masters. Braun\'s purchase drew massive criticism from Swift and her fans, as he had in the past been linked with rival Kanye West, Swift\'s arch-nemesis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just a year later, Braun had sold Swift\'s masters to private equity firm Shamrock Capital for a reported $300 million. Five years later, Swift has since repurchased them from Shamrock. The figure had been rumored to be close to $1 billion, but sources say the figure was hugely inflated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Did Taylor Buy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This record-breaking contract has more than just sound recordings. It was explained by Swift that she not only possesses the master recordings but also ancillary material like music videos, concert films, album artwork, and unreleased tracks. <em>\"I am endlessly grateful,\"</em> she explained, even suggesting her first tattoo can be a giant shamrock on her forehead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Swift thanked Shamrock Capital for good-faith negotiations and thanked her fans for their support: <em>\"You helped reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Impact of Rerecording</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During the years following the initial sale, Swift embarked on a groundbreaking rerecording effort to reclaim her music and dilute Braun\'s investment. Each album rerelease was labeled<em> \"(Taylor\'s Version),\"</em> with some featuring never-before-heard songs \"From the Vault.\" These remastered versions of Fearless, Red, Speak Now, and 1989 shattered records and earned rave reviews.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But now that she has regained her original masters, the fate of the other two unreleased re-recordings &mdash; Reputation and her 2006 self-titled album &mdash; is also in question.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Era for Artist Empowerment</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Swift\'s newfound success is not just an individual victory &mdash; it\'s symbolic of artistic independence. The battle over Taylor Swift music ownership has inspired a new generation of artists to fight for control of their craft. Swift revealed that many young artists now negotiate for master ownership upfront in the early stages of their careers because of her very public battle.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Each time a new artist comes up to me and says they negotiated to own their master recordings&hellip; I\'m reminded of just how much it mattered that all of this occurred,\" she wrote. \"Each and every piece of it made its way here.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next for Swift?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even after accomplishing what most people considered impossible, Swift does not seem to be going anywhere. Since 2020, she has released four new albums: Folklore, Evermore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department. Her Eras Tour was the highest-grossing tour in history, earning over $2 billion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though she won\'t confirm if Reputation (Taylor\'s Version) is coming, she did admit to having only partially rerecorded it. But the fans may yet get to hear the \"From the Vault\" tracks, as Swift indicated she\'s open to putting them out \"if you\'re into the idea.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Remarks </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Taylor Swift music ownership returns to the news, this is a conclusion to one of the most high-profile artist-vs.-record-label battles in recent music history. Taylor Swift has rewritten the playbook &mdash; not just for herself, but for a generation of artists seeking to take control. With all her catalog in her possession now, the next Taylor Swift album will be the best one ever.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-03', '00:14:21', 'taylor-swift-music-ownership-win-she-finally-owns-it-all', 'article/visionaries-network-taylor-swift-music-ownership-win.webp', 'Taylor Swift Reclaims Full Rights to Her Music Catalog', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-taylor-swift-music-ownership-win.webp', 6, 2025, 'Taylor Swift, music ownership, Taylor&#039;s Version, album rights, Swifties, pop music, visionaries network, artist rights, music industry, visionary network  Speak Now', 'Taylor Swift now owns her entire music catalog after years of re-recording her albums, marking a major victory for artist rights.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

His public statements are always replete with dire warnings about the state of the U.S. economy, but the numbers lie.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since then, over the last decade, JPMorgan has made record yearly profits, such as $58.5 billion in a single year alone in 2024. Despite Jamie Dimon economic predictions &mdash; presented as Jamie Dimon economic estimates &mdash; the bank has continued to gain ground on competitors and solidify itself as the world\'s most valuable publicly traded financial institution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From trading and investment banking to credit cards and retail credit, JPMorgan\'s dominance pervades all the major <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/charles-schwab-stock-forecast-2025-is-schw-a-smart-buy-now\">financial segments</a></span>. Its aggressive investment in technology, including <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/perplexity-comet-browser-promises-smarter-ai-powered-search\">artificial intelligence</a></span>, is future-proofing the bank\'s operations and keeping it at the cutting edge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Forecasting Crisis to Prevent Complacency</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So why does Dimon continue to make apocalyptic warnings even when the prospects are rosy? Most of the analysts are of the opinion that his pessimistic rhetoric is a deliberate strategy. By cautioning publicly against possible slumps, inflation, or global conflicts, Dimon keeps his top management on their toes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"He\'s building a war-room atmosphere,\" said Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. \"He wants his team to be ready to roll, and Jamie Dimon economic predictions are one way to do that.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The banking sector is notoriously cyclical, and Dimon\'s history of weathering the 2008 financial crisis and taking over failed institutions such as Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual has made him wary. He is constantly reminding stakeholders that large banks can also fail when they get complacent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"It\'s a tough world out there,\" Dimon recently told JPMorgan\'s investor day, reinforcing the point that preparation&mdash;even for low-probability risks&mdash;distinguishes successful institutions from failed ones.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Betting on Caution: A Winning Strategy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is a good argument to be made that Dimon\'s steady conservatism has kept JPMorgan out of the trouble that ensnared other banks. Dimon cautioned for years about increasing interest rates &mdash; a prospect that many scoffed at when the 10-year Treasury yield was nearing 1%. When rates exploded in 2023, JPMorgan was among the few companies ready for the blow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Financial analyst Mike Mayo put it best: \"A good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining.\" And Dimon, with his numerous Jamie Dimon economic predictions, has demonstrated that planning for the worst has a way of placing you best when the worst happens.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even though some investors may believe his warnings are hyperbolic &mdash; especially when markets are strong &mdash; Dimon\'s strategy has succeeded. The paradox that he is pessimistic yet JPMorgan is doing superbly may be baffling for some people, but in high finance, it is a leadership practice of strategy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As JPMorgan grows stronger, Dimon\'s economic warnings might strike some as alarmist. But in a business that\'s fraught with uncertainty, his warning voice might be just what keeps the bank afloat, let alone prospering.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thought</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether or not Jamie Dimon economic predictions prove true, his leadership approach has positioned JPMorgan in front of nearly every curve.

While devoted fans were thrilled with the news, The Last of Us season 3 news update comes with a tinge of skepticism.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to creators and performers, much of season 3 is still in production, and it might be years before we have the pleasure of watching it on our television screens.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a May 23 press conference, showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann confirmed season 3 is coming, but they were up-front about where it stands: writing isn\'t finished, and big story choices remain to be made.

The automotive giant is all ready to launch the highly anticipated Tata Harrier EV on June 3, its sixth consumer electric car. Following its first unveiling at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo and after numerous public road trials, the electric version of the Harrier SUV is now all ready to hit Indian showrooms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Harrier EV was initially showcased as a concept at the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Auto+Expo+2020&amp;cvid=a4b0f793f5644ff6b474ef255bfb5a4d&amp;gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQABhAMgYIAhAAGEAyBggDEAAYQDIGCAQQABhAMgYIBRAAGEAyBggGEAAYQDIGCAcQABhAMgYICBAAGEDSAQczNTJqMGo0qAIIsAIB&amp;FORM=ANAB01&amp;PC=U531\">Auto Expo 2020</a></span>, and in recent months, there has been so much hype with spy shots, teaser videos, and feature releases. With the launch date looming near, here\'s what we know about the much-awaited electric SUV.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Real Electric SUV: Based on Tata\'s Acti.ev Platform</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While it appears nearly identical to its internal combustion engine (ICE) cousin, the Harrier EV is based on Tata\'s state-of-the-art Acti.ev Gen 2 electric vehicle platform. Built from the ground up for electrification, the platform has improved battery packaging, safety, and efficiency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From a styling perspective, the Harrier EV has an electric car-like close front grille, split headlamps with LEDs, sequential turn indicators, and fresh bumpers with fresh skid plates. It\'s sporting new aerodynamic alloy wheels and has a tidy charging port on the right-hand side.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>High-End Interiors and Future-Focused Features</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Internally, the Harrier EV will be loaded with a tech-laden, premium experience. The Stealth Edition will have a blacked-out interior, while the regular models will have a dual-tone dashboard. A massive 12.3-inch Harman infotainment display and a 10.25-inch all-digital instrument panel will be the technology highlight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The other things to look forward to are wireless Android Auto and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/mahindra-be6-xev-9e-wireless-apple-carplay-update-rolls-out\">Apple CarPlay</a></span>, a 10-speaker JBL audio system, dual-zone climate control, ventilated front seats with climate control, voice-activated panoramic sunroof, and ambient lighting. Tata has also equipped the SUV with vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging features &mdash; perfect for charging appliances or helping other EVs in need.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Safety and Driver Assistance</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Safety has taken top priority in the Harrier EV by Tata. It would have 7 airbags, a 360-degree camera, and Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). These include adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, emergency braking, and others &mdash; and it would be among the safest mid-size EVs in India.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Power and Range</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though official full specifications have not been revealed yet, a dual-motor all-wheel-drive (AWD) setup has been confirmed by Tata. Latest teasers saw the Harrier EV traversing a quite steep 34-degree incline, showcasing some serious off-road capability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The SUV will produce around 500 Nm of torque and will have a range of well over 500 km on a single charge. Although we have no information on the battery capacity, these numbers suggest Tata is aiming at a new benchmark for the segment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Competitors and competitive pricing</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Harrier EV will have to be priced between Rs 22&ndash;23 lakh (ex-showroom), which will position it to directly challenge Mahindra\'s future XUV.e9 and XUV.e7. Tata\'s past practice of going aggressively low on pricing has been successful and will be successful this time as well, and will absolutely appeal to urban professionals and EV enthusiasts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Word: Tata Motors Is the Leader of Electric Vehicles in India</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the Harrier EV, Tata Motors is the leader of electric vehicles, which is unmatched with a portfolio that spans several segments &mdash; from hatchbacks to premium SUVs. The Harrier EV not only expands Tata\'s presence but also sets a benchmark for Indian customers for what an electric SUV made in India can offer.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As we await the official roll-out, here is something that we can be certain of: Tata Motors is India\'s EV champion &mdash; and the Harrier EV is a big leap into the era of green mobility.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-04', '23:25:23', 'harrier-ev-launch-proves-tata-motors-is-the-ev-leader', 'article/visionaries-network-harrierev-launch-proves-tata-motors.webp', 'Harrier EV Launch Proves Tata Motors Is the EV Leader', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-harrierev-launch-proves-tata-motors.webp', 6, 2025, 'Tata Motors, Harrier EV, electric vehicle, EV launch, Tata EV, India EV market, SUV EV, green mobility, Tata electric SUV, Harrier electric, sustainable cars, EV innovation, Tata auto, visionaries network', 'Tata Motors launches the Harrier EV, solidifying its position as India&#039;s electric vehicle leader with innovation, style, and sustainability.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

The patch may look small on paper but has giant changes that will make a huge difference for solo players exploring the deadly realms of Nightreign.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Auto-Revive Mechanic Changes the Game for Solo Players</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The biggest news of the Elden Ring Nightreign patch 1.01.1 notes is the addition of a game-saver feature: Automatic Revival Upon Defeat for solo-player nighttime boss battles. The feature allows you to revive once in a boss fight, with a maximum of three revivals total per session &mdash; but only if you\'re solo, solo.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This change seems to be FromSoftware\'s way of giving solo adventurers a minor but worthwhile edge in a world that, at times, can be more than one can manage. In addition, rune rewards are increased for solo players, so the lone-wolf option is as effective &mdash; and rewarding &mdash; as ever.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Additional High-Rarity Relics from Day 3</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Not everything was revealed prior to the changes. The Elden Ring Nightreign patch 1.01.1 notes contain some stealthy changes that enhance the gameplay. After you\'ve hit Day 3 of your journey, the probability of getting high-rarity Relics has been significantly enhanced.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The characters also possess a higher chance of obtaining such high-end Relics by interacting with the Scenic Flat stones that they acquire from the Small Jar Bazaar. These micro-balance tweaks appear to be aimed at characters who are already performing well but need a little push halfway through the game.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Steam Version Bug Fixes and Quality Improvements</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to the gameplay adjustments, the new update also addresses a broad spectrum of performance issues, particularly for Steam users. A number of bugs that focused on animation glitches and graphics quality have been streamlined. These are not showy adjustments, but they provide a little more sheen to the game\'s PC experience, particularly in high-density visual environments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the fact that players were looking forward to most of these coming in with next week\'s patch 1.02, FromSoftware came and shocked us all by dropping some of the most highly anticipated additions early &mdash; courtesy of their strange numbering system. This shows that they are committed to delivering player demands in a timely manner, even as Nightreign keeps rolling out globally.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Community reactions remain polarized, primarily due to the extreme difficulty curve of the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/eco-friendly-video-games-2025-to-shine-at-summer-game-fest\">game</a></span> and the absence of support for duo-play. These additional changes should, however, make the game a bit more balanced and less punish-y for single-player players.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether you\'re starting the game for the first time or returning after frustration with the initial boss battles, the Elden Ring Nightreign patch 1.01.1 notes offer a couple of reasons why you might want to play through it again &mdash; especially if you\'re playing solo and would like a more even battle and better loot.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-05', '23:09:44', 'elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1-01-1-notes-buff-solo-play', 'article/visionaries-network-elden-ring-nightreign.webp', 'Elden Ring Nightreign Patch 1.01.1 Enhances Solo Play', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-elden-ring-nightreign.webp', 6, 2025, 'Elden Ring, Nightreign, Patch 1.01.1, solo play, revive items, Wending Grace, rune acquisition, quality of life, FromSoftware, boss battles, solo experience, update, gameplay, Visionaries network, solo buffs', 'Elden Ring Nightreign Patch 1.01.1 boosts solo play with Wending Grace items, revive support, and improved rune rewards, enhancing the single-player experience.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Discovery to Split Into Two Companies by 2026', 'Entertainment and Recreation', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a move to guide the changing tides of the media universe,&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.wbd.com/\">Warner Bros. Discovery</a></span> to split into two companies&mdash;a move announced Monday that is set to define the future of the media giant. The split, to be implemented by mid-2026, will create two listed entities: one focused on streaming and content creation and the other focused on traditional television and cable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>David Zaslav to Head Streaming Division</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and content creation business. The new entity will own some of the group\'s most recognizable brands: Warner Bros. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/the-last-of-us-season-3-news-update-what-we-know-so-far\">film</a></span> and TV studios, <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/harry-potter-hbo-cast-2025-meet-the-new-trio-at-hogwarts\">HBO</a></span>, HBO Max, and its growing games and experiences division.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Zaslav emphasized that the split would allow the two companies to do what they do best, stating, \"By being two standalone and optimized companies in the future, we are giving these iconic brands the sharper focus and strategic agility they need to compete best in today\'s shifting media landscape.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The streaming division has found favor in recent times with successes like The White Lotus and The Pitt. Though Warner lost the rights to broadcast the NBA, it still managed to hold its own in negotiating favorable terms in new distribution deals with cable and satellite providers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Gunnar Wiedenfels to Manage Conventional TV Division</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, the company\'s CFO, Gunnar Wiedenfels, who is best known for leading cost-cutting initiatives, will lead the legacy TV business. That division will oversee Warner\'s international TV networks and digital brands such as Discovery+, Bleacher Report, and CNN\'s new streaming businesses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This restructuring follows closely on the heels of Comcast\'s recent decision to spin off NBCUniversal\'s majority interest in a new public company, Versant, but keep its broadcast and streaming operations under the NBC umbrella. It is part of a larger industry trend: major media conglomerates are beginning to see that putting traditional TV and streaming together under one roof may not be the best model.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Warner Bros. Discovery to Split into Two Companies Is a Good Idea</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The logic for Warner Bros. Discovery to split into two companies stems from the recent woes of the company. Since the AT&amp;T WarnerMedia and Discovery Communications merger timing, Warner has struggled with the fall in cable revenue, adjustments in streaming approaches, and the diminishment of such marquee cable properties as TNT and TBS. The loss of NBA rights was an additional blow, undermining one of its most consistent audience drivers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By spinning off its businesses, Warner is seeking to cut out competition for resources within and enable each company to focus on its niche market. The streaming business can splurge on content and user interface, and the TV business can optimize returns from current assets and seek out new digital opportunities without distraction.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The split will be finalized by mid-2026, pending approvals. Meanwhile, the two divisions will be under the banner of Warner Bros. Discovery, with preparations for functioning as independently as possible underway.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This move would free shareholder value that is currently latent and set each company up to compete in its own niche&mdash;either to stream or to broadcast television. The real test will come later, however, as the two independent companies will attempt to stand on their own in a highly competitive media landscape. Essentially, the reality that Warner Bros.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Discovery will be split into two companies is more than a reshuffle&mdash;it\'s a harbinger of a changing landscape where specialization, not just scale, will be the key to success in the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-09', '23:33:48', 'warner-bros--discovery-to-split-into-two-companies-by-2026', 'article/visionaries-network-warner-bros-discovery-to-split-into-two.webp', 'Warner Bros.

(UNFI)</a></span>, the largest distributor of natural, organic, and specialty foods in North America, is facing a major operational crisis. On June 5, 2025, the company reported detecting unauthorized activity in its IT systems, sparking concerns across the industry. This UNFI cyberattack 2025 incident underscores the growing threat of cybercrime within critical sectors like food distribution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">UNFI is an essential part of the food supply chain, serving nearly 30,000 U.S. and Canadian stores. Its long-term partnership with Whole Foods, now until 2032, highlights its strategic importance. Its $8.2 billion in net sales in the fourth quarter proves its size, scope, and market share. But even a behemoth like this is susceptible to cyberattacks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Rapid Response During Security Gap</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">After discovering the breach, UNFI immediately disconnected affected systems to contain the damage. Although the company has not confirmed the exact nature of the attack, the response suggests a possible ransomware event. These types of attacks can encrypt critical data and demand payment for decryption keys, severely halting operations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The UNFI cyberattack 2025 has already had tangible effects. Distribution slowdowns have led to product shortages, with Whole Foods markets across various states having bare shelves. Social media posts include images of apology signs describing the temporary absence of stock. This was the first concrete effect for many customers that they experienced regarding what was becoming increasingly one of the largest cyber events in the U.S. food supply chain to date.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Response, Recovery, and Investigation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the wake of the attack, UNFI activated its cyber response protocols. The company is collaborating with federal law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity specialists to investigate the breach. While the investigation remains in its early stages, UNFI&rsquo;s public communications have emphasized its commitment to restoring systems securely and minimizing customer disruptions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Stopgap measures have been instituted to reinstate partial order completion and distribution services. However, with UNFI being such a major supplier, ripple effects will continue for days, if not weeks. Food chains that rely on UNFI are searching for ways to come up with alternative distribution methods in the meantime.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Financial Implications and Market Response </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Investors responded quickly to the news. UNFI&rsquo;s stock price fell by over 6% following the announcement, with a sharper 9% drop during early trading hours. The market reaction highlights growing investor sensitivity to cyber incidents, especially in critical infrastructure sectors like food and retail logistics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The UNFI cyberattack 2025 also questions the monetary cost&mdash;short-term and long-term&mdash;of cybersecurity failures. From possible ransom payments and system restoration to legal penalties and lost business, the overall cost may be significant. Industry experts believe that massive ransomware attacks can result in millions of dollars in direct and indirect loss for large companies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Wake-Up Call to the Food Industry</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">UNFI\'s crisis is not an isolated incident. The food and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2024/07/bhoomi-namaskar-anthem-launched\">agriculture industry</a></span> has grown more susceptible to cyber attacks. It has been the target of high-profile cyberattacks against companies such as JBS, Dole, Sysco, and Americold in recent years. Those intrusions reflect a sector that remains poorly prepared for the security needs of the digital age.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The UNFI cyberattack 2025 is a wake-up call for food distributors everywhere. As operations grow more reliant on digital logistics, warehouse automation, and real-time inventory systems, the importance of cybersecurity only intensifies. Companies must view cyber resilience not as an IT expense, but as a core business requirement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While UNFI continues to recover, the broader industry must take note. The days of underestimating cyber threats are over. For a company that fuels the shelves of 30,000 stores, digital security is now as vital as supply chain efficiency. The UNFI cyberattack 2025 won\'t be the last of these things&mdash;but maybe it\'ll be the one that finally gets food distribution to pay attention to cybersecurity.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-10', '22:52:22', 'unfi-cyberattack-2025-disrupts-food-supply-chain-operations', 'article/visionaries-network-unfi-cyberattack-2025-disrupts-food-supply.webp', 'UNFI Cyberattack 2025 Disrupts Food Supply Chain', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-unfi-cyberattack-2025-disrupts-food-supply.webp', 6, 2025, 'UNFI, cyberattack, 2025, food supply chain, disruption, security breach, logistics, ransomware, visionaries network, retail, grocery, data breach, operations, hacking, cybersecurity', 'A 2025 cyberattack on UNFI disrupts food supply chain operations, causing delays, outages, and widespread concerns across grocery and retail sectors.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

(230, NULL, 'Hurricane Barbara 2025: First Pacific Storm Alert', 'Hurricane Barbara 2025: First Pacific Storm Raises Concerns', 'Environment Power and Clean Energy', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tropical Storm Barbara became a hurricane on Monday, June 9, 2025, according to the&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/\">National Hurricane Center (NHC)</a></span>. Now officially classified as Hurricane Barbara 2025, the storm is the first hurricane of this year&rsquo;s Pacific season, bringing with it early signs of what could be an active summer for tropical weather.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Barbara formed off the coast of southwestern Mexico over the weekend and strengthened rapidly into a Category 1 hurricane by Monday afternoon. With maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and gusts nearing 100 mph, Hurricane Barbara 2025 is currently churning west-northwest over open ocean, moving at about 14 mph.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Will Hurricane Barbara Hit the U.S.?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As of now, Hurricane Barbara 2025 is not expected to pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland. The storm remains far off the coast and is forecast to continue moving away from land. However, its wide influence may generate high surf, dangerous rip currents, and minor coastal flooding in parts of Baja California and potentially southern California by late this week.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The National Hurricane Center has not issued any coastal watches or warnings for U.S. regions. Still, experts recommend keeping an eye on the forecast in case the storm&rsquo;s path shifts unexpectedly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;Although Barbara is currently tracking away from the coast, we always advise the public to stay informed during hurricane season,&rdquo; said Dr. Elena Ruiz, senior forecaster at the NHC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Barbara Formed Early in the Season</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While hurricanes forming in early June are relatively rare, they are not unheard of in the Eastern Pacific, where warm ocean temperatures and favorable atmospheric conditions can speed up storm development. The official Eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15, making Barbara an early but not unprecedented event.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meteorologists note that Hurricane Barbara 2025 rapidly evolved from a tropical depression into a hurricane in just over 24 hours&mdash;a sign of favorable storm-building conditions in the Pacific.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Could It Influence U.S. Weather?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even though it may not make landfall, Barbara&rsquo;s wide wind field and moisture plume could influence weather patterns in the southwestern U.S., especially in states like Arizona and New Mexico, bringing scattered rainfall and slightly cooler temperatures. Some weather models indicate remnants of the storm could increase humidity and lead to thunderstorms later in the week.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/northern-lights-tonight-best-u-s--viewing-locations\">Climate</a></span> experts are also warning of a potentially above-average hurricane season, driven by neutral El Ni&ntilde;o conditions and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Reminder to Stay Prepared </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether or not Barbara impacts the U.S. directly, it&rsquo;s a strong reminder that hurricane season is underway. Experts urge residents in coastal regions&mdash;both Pacific and Atlantic&mdash;to review their emergency plans, update disaster kits, and stay tuned to alerts from official weather agencies. &ldquo;Every storm is different, and every season can surprise us,&rdquo; Dr. Ruiz emphasized. &ldquo;Preparedness now means safety later.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-10', '23:04:07', 'hurricane-barbara-2025-first-pacific-storm-raises-concerns', 'article/visionaries-network-hurricane-barbara-2025-first-pacific.webp', 'Hurricane Barbara 2025', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-hurricane-barbara-2025-first-pacific.webp', 6, 2025, 'Hurricane Barbara, 2025 storm, Pacific hurricane, tropical storm, weather alert, hurricane news, storm tracking, NOAA, visionaries network, Barbara update, storm season, disaster warning, Pacific weather, hurricane path, emergency prep', 'Hurricane Barbara 2025 becomes the first Pacific storm of the season, raising concerns with its growing strength and potential impact.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(231, '', 'US CPI May 2025: Inflation Slows, Fed Policy Eyed', 'US CPI Data May 2025 Shows Inflation Slows, Fed in Focus', 'banking and fintech', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US CPI data May 2025 release by the&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/\">Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a></span> has brought a mix of cautious optimism and ongoing concern. The annual inflation rate in the United States rose slightly to 2.4% in May from 2.3% in April, marking the first acceleration in four months. However, it remained below the forecasted 2.5%, hinting at a more moderate inflationary trend that could support the case for a Federal Reserve rate cut in the near future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On a monthly basis, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) edged up 0.1%, down from 0.2% in April and short of the 0.2% forecast. The most significant contributor to this monthly rise was shelter, which increased by 0.3%. In contrast, the energy index declined by 1%, offering some relief to households and businesses alike.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remained unchanged at 2.8% year-over-year&mdash;still the lowest since 2021. Monthly core CPI ticked up just 0.1%, compared to 0.2% in April, and underperformed the 0.3% expectation. This marks a key development for investors and policymakers watching inflationary pressures closely.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Shifts in CPI Calculation and Market Response</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Notably, May 2025\'s release incorporated changes in how the CPI is calculated. Beginning with April&rsquo;s data (released in May), the BLS now uses transaction-based data for leased cars and trucks rather than survey responses. This adjustment is aimed at increasing the precision of pricing metrics within the transportation category.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Markets responded positively to the softer-than-expected numbers. US stock futures rose on Wednesday morning following the release. The S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4%, the Nasdaq 100 increased by 0.5%, and Dow futures jumped 130 points. Tech giants such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta rose between 0.4% and 0.7% in premarket trading. Tesla led the charge with a nearly 3% surge after CEO Elon Musk softened his rhetoric towards former President Trump, contributing to improved investor sentiment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Political and Economic Crosscurrents</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US CPI data May 2025 comes at a politically sensitive moment. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/bitcoin-price-after-trump-news-boosts-crypto-market-sentiment\">President Trump</a></span> has been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth ahead of the 2025 presidential campaign season. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained a cautious stance, signaling that any policy moves will be driven solely by economic data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"The Fed won\'t cut rates unless the data justifies it,\" Powell reiterated at a recent event, highlighting inflation control as the central bank&rsquo;s priority.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geopolitical dynamics are also at play. Ongoing US-China trade talks have brought both tension and potential relief. President Trump announced a tentative deal that includes China supplying rare earth minerals to the US, while both countries plan to impose new tariffs&mdash;China at 10% and the US at a more aggressive 55%. These tariffs may affect prices of imported goods in the coming months, possibly feeding back into future CPI readings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead to the June Fed Meeting</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All eyes are now on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for June 17&ndash;18. The meeting will include the release of the Fed&rsquo;s \"dot plot,\" which outlines interest rate expectations from each member. Should inflation remain moderate or soften further, there could be a stronger case for a rate cut later this year&mdash;something markets have been eagerly anticipating.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For now, the US CPI data May 2025 has provided a much-needed breather for investors and consumers. With core inflation stable and overall price increases subdued, the Federal Reserve may have more room to maneuver without risking runaway inflation. However, with ongoing trade tensions and changes in CPI methodology, the economic outlook remains dynamic and unpredictable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As markets await the Fed&rsquo;s next move, one thing is clear: inflation may be cooling, but the policy debate is just heating up.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-11', '00:09:07', 'us-cpi-may-2025-inflation-slows-fed-policy-eyed', 'article/visionaries-network-us-cpi-data-may-2025-shows-inflation2.webp', 'US CPI May 2025: Inflation Slows, Fed Policy Eyed', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-us-cpi-data-may-2025-shows-inflation2.webp', 6, 2025, 'US CPI, May 2025 inflation, Fed policy, inflation data, consumer prices, Federal Reserve, economic data, US economy, visionaries network, core CPI, CPI report, inflation trends, monetary policy, market reaction, economic indicators', 'US CPI data for May 2025 shows slowing inflation, shifting market focus to the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s next policy move.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

(233, NULL, 'Gold Forecast: XAU/USD Eyes Breakout Above $3400', 'Gold Prices Forecast: XAU/USD Eyes Breakout Above $3400', 'banking and fintech', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gold prices hit a one-week high on Thursday following weak U.S. inflation numbers that boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates in the later part of the year. The XAU/USD is trading at $3386.07, a gain of $30.82 or +0.92%, close to the significant resistance at $3403.63. A break above here would be an extension of the trend and put the May 6 high at $3435.06 within sight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This rally was partly driven by the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed U.S. inflation rose just 0.1% in May, below the 0.2% forecast. CPI was up 2.5% year-over-year, and that caused the U.S. dollar index (DXY) to drop 0.3% to a two-month low. While the dollar declined, foreign investors found gold more attractive.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Betting on Rate Cut Pushes Gold Up</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The gold prices forecast has become more bullish because the market now anticipates at least 50 basis points of rate cuts in 2025. Fed funds futures have a 68% chance of a rate cut in September. Declining Treasury yields also underpin gold\'s rally, with the 10-year at 4.387% and the 2-year at 3.926%. These decreases reduce the price of not earning interest on non-yielding gold and tend to induce buying during rate cut cycles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rally in gold is also fueled by growing speculation that the Fed will become more aggressive if disinflation continues or labor measures begin to weaken. If disinflation does continue, the Fed would have to start easing ahead of time, analysts at Goldman Sachs point out.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Safe-Haven Demand Due to Geopolitical Tensions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Geopolitical risk is providing gold with another tailwind. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/micron-technology-adds-surcharge-to-offset-trump-tariffs\">President Donald Trump</a></span> affirmed that the U.S. is relocating personnel in the Middle East as tensions with Iran remain high. Trump also affirmed that the U.S. is dedicated to keeping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the meantime, ties between the U.S. and China continued, such as consent on a new trade agreement for rare earth resources and easing restrictions on Chinese students in the US. While this temporarily steadied markets, the overall environment is still fragile, sustaining high demand for traditional safe-haven assets like gold.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>PPI Numbers Could Determine What Comes Next</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Markets now look to the next U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) announcement. An additional <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/us-cpi-may-2025-inflation-slows-fed-policy-eyed\">inflation</a></span> downside shock would be conducive to Fed rate cut expectations and push gold beyond the $3400 resistance level.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If XAU/USD breaks above $3403.63, technical momentum can take it to the May 6 high at $3435.06. Downside support is first at $3310.48, with stronger support near the 50-day moving average at $3279.30.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Gold Prices Forecast Is Optimistic </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Overall, the gold prices forecast is still bullish with falling yields, a weaker dollar, and rising geopolitical risk. Absent a shift in tone based on new economic data or Federal Reserve commentary, the tone for gold is to rise. With a number of tailwinds&mdash;softer inflation, to name a few, and global uncertainty&mdash;gold is growing well-positioned as a resilient asset in the latter half of 2025. Investors must remain vigilant for crucial data points and levels of resistance as XAU/USD approaches a key breakout area.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-13', '00:10:33', 'gold-prices-forecast-xauusd-eyes-breakout-above-3400', 'article/visionaries-network-gold-prices-forecast.webp', 'Gold Forecast: XAU/USD Eyes Breakout Above $3400', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-gold-prices-forecast.webp', 6, 2025, 'gold price, XAU/USD, gold forecast, breakout level, gold resistance, gold trading, precious metals, gold market, inflation hedge, safe haven, gold rally, visionaries network, spot gold, gold futures, market forecast', 'Gold prices near $3,400 with XAU/USD set for a breakout amid weak dollar, inflation data, and geopolitical tensions boosting demand for safe-haven assets.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(234, NULL, 'Silent Hill 1 Remake Confirmed &ndash; Classic Horror Returns', 'Silent Hill 1 Remake Confirmed: Classic Horror Returns Soon', 'Entertainment and Recreation', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a massive reveal that thrilled horror game fans across the globe, Japanese video game developer&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.konami.com/en/\">Konami</a></span> officially announced the Silent Hill 1 remake through its Press Start Live streaming event. The iconic 1999 survival horror title is getting a total overhaul, with the re-creation of the title being assigned to Bloober Team, the same developer remaking Silent Hill 2.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even without any formal announcement of the release date, news of the Silent Hill 1 remake has been enough to create waves of enthusiasm throughout the gaming world. The fans are eagerly anticipating returning to the foggy town of Silent Hill, but with better graphics, smarter gameplay mechanics, and a better experience due to next-generation hardware.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Back to the Horrors of the Beginning: What Silent Hill 1 Was</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">First released on PlayStation in 1999, Silent Hill was developed by Team Silent and released by Konami. The game would quickly become a survival-horror genre-defining title. The <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/xbox-game-pass-may-2025-lineup-adds-monster-train-2-and-more\">game</a></span> follows the tale of Harry Mason, a normal guy who travels to the creepy town of Silent Hill in search of his adopted daughter, Cheryl, who had disappeared.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What differentiated Silent Hill was its combination of psychological horror and atmospheric storytelling. Instead of using jump scares or gore, the game instead provided a gradual build-up of fear. Fog and darkness effectively concealed the system\'s graphical limitations as well as contributing to the claustrophobic environment. The unsettling sound design&mdash;replete with static-filled radio communications and dissonant industrial sounds&mdash;also helped to set the game\'s unnerving atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">They had to unravel puzzles, ration limited resources like ammo and health, and fight horrific monsters, while discovering a sinister plot about a secret cult and satanic rituals. With player-determined endings, Silent Hill innovated branching narratives that would find their way into hundreds of terrifying games in the coming decades.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Beginning for Silent Hill</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Silent Hill 1 remake will retain the core concepts of psychological horror, exploration, and survival but enhance everything from the graphics to the controls. Bloober Team is renowned for being industry masters of psychological horror based on their experience with Layers of Fear, The Medium, and now working with Konami on a few Silent Hill titles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although gameplay videos of the remake have not yet been made public, the fan community is already wondering what will be changed. Will the remake include the set camera angles that made the original feel so cramped, or will it follow a more contemporary third- or first-person perspective? Whatever direction the developers go, the fan community wants the game to remain true to its heritage while improving for new players.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Silent Hill F: A Glimpse to the Future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the remake announcement, Konami also unveiled Silent Hill F, a new game in the series that will be available in stores on September 25. The game is the first Silent Hill title being released in Japan and appears to be the beginning of the series\' new story. Developers unveiled a trailer of the game\'s eerie atmosphere and design, which promises a terrifying experience based on Japanese legends.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From initial sneak peeks, Silent Hill F is billed as a different kind of horror&mdash;less misty towns and more rotting beauty and existential terror. It\'s a rebranding for the series and might be a companion piece to the nostalgia trip offered by the remastered Silent Hill 1.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The announcement of the Silent Hill 1 remake isn\'t a nostalgic nod back to a fan favorite game&mdash;it\'s a statement of intent that Konami is serious about bringing the series back. By marrying new technology with the spooky storytelling that made the original great, the remake can hopefully entice a new generation of players while satisfying longtime fans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While we await further details, one thing we can be sure of is the fact that horror is coming back big, and Silent Hill is leading the charge again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-13', '23:28:51', 'silent-hill-1-remake-confirmed-classic-horror-returns-soon', 'article/visionaries-network-sillent-hill-remake.webp', 'Silent Hill 1 Remake Confirmed: Classic Horror Returns Soon', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-sillent-hill-remake.webp', 6, 2025, 'Silent Hill, Silent Hill remake, horror game, PS5, Konami, survival horror, classic game, SH1, remake news, game trailer, horror fans, upcoming games, visionaries network, horror remake, classic reboot', 'Silent Hill 1 Remake is officially confirmed!

Spaceballs enthusiasts all around are rejoicing: the ridiculously beloved sci-fi spoof is finally in the process of receiving a sequel film after almost four decades since Spaceballs struck the big screens in 1987, and the comedic power is with this one.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hollywood legend and director Mel Brooks, mastermind of the original Spaceballs, has officially announced he will once more don his legendary character\'s hat as Yogurt. Brooks, who wrote, directed, and starred in the 1987 box office smash, also broke the huge news in a comedic tweet on X (formerly Twitter) on June 12, 2025, saying: \"I told you we\'d be back.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The announcement trailer, a parody Star Wars scrolling opening, is a sendup of the seemingly endless parade of sequels, prequels, and remakes that have been released in the wake of their original ancestors since the original Spaceballs. The trailer mock titles everything from Dune and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/harry-potter-hbo-cast-2025-meet-the-new-trio-at-hogwarts\">Harry Potter</a></span> to 36 MCU films with two different Robert Downey Jrs.&mdash;and concludes with Brooks wearing a sweatshirt with: \"SPACEBALLS THE SWEATSHIRT.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Josh Gad, who starred in Frozen and Beauty and the Beast, is on-screen and off-screen as a co-writer in the new film. Off-screen co-writers are Benji Samit and Dan Hernandez, and the director is Josh Greenbaum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Gad\'s enthusiasm was unveiled on Instagram, where he wrote, \"I was the kid who saw Spaceballs first and then saw Star Wars and was like, \'Why in the world would someone remake the Mel Brooks classic in a dramatic redo?\'\" He continued that to collaborate with Brooks on the sequel is \"the greatest gift of my life.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Things We Know About the Spaceballs 2 Sequel</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So far, however, the title and plot of the Spaceballs 2 sequel have been kept secret. Amazon-MGM, the company making the film, teased it as a \"Non-Prequel Non-Reboot Sequel Part Two\" with \"Reboot Elements Franchise Expansion Film\"&mdash;a snarky description that is the very tone that the fans are craving.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Spaceballs 2 will hit theaters in 2027, the 40th anniversary of the original\'s theatrical release. The highly anticipated sequel comes after a decade of rumor, false starts, and anticipation from the fans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Who\'s in the Cast?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though the entire cast has not yet been announced, positive news is already in for new and repeat cast members. Mel Brooks is officially signed to play Yogurt, and Josh Gad will appear in a yet-to-be-announced character.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Rick Moranis will reprise as the comedically sinister Dark Helmet, a brief on-screen comeback for the actor who left Hollywood decades earlier. Princess Vespa will be reprised by Daphne Zuniga, and Bill Pullman will be back, potentially handing the torch over to his on-screen son.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pullman\'s real-life son, Lewis Pullman, is said to be playing \"Starburst,\" the new-generation space hero. Nope and Good Fortune\'s Keke Palmer will also join the cast in a role that is not specified but is said to bring new comic energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Could the Plot Be?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No official synopsis has come out, but since the original\'s satirical take on Star Wars, its sequel Spaceballs 2 would not have any difficulty satirizing our contemporary pop culture obsessions&mdash;ranging from film franchises to streaming wars extravaganzas. Moranis\'s Dark Helmet and Brooks\'s Yogurt are returning for the sequel, so we can likely anticipate more humorous misadventures across the galaxy, but with new sets of heroes and villains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Considering how the original Spaceballs wrapped up&mdash;with Yogurt cracking wise about \"Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money\"&mdash;it is likely that that meta joke happens.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>If you\'re a Star Wars enthusiast, a Mel Brooks enthusiast, or simply an enthusiast of a good belly laugh, the Spaceballs 2 sequel does not disappoint: the kind of over-the-top comedy the world is waiting for.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s a long time coming back to a universe where the Schwartz is paramount&mdash;and no genre is fair game to spoof.

David Gibson, a senior research analyst at MST Financial, said to CNBC he is forecasting 20 million sales for the year through March 2026.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Switch 2, which launched on June 5, has also performed well, with people waiting out late night openings at Nintendo retail stores.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Fans around the globe are sharing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as a next-level way to play at home and away,\" Nintendo of America President and Chief Operating Officer Doug Bowser said in a statement, responding to the reaction the company received.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nintendo stocks traded in Tokyo, up nearly 30% so far this year, declined 3.5% on Wednesday, LSEG data showed. The company has had its shares increase nearly fivefold since the first Switch came out in early March 2017.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether the Switch 2 can repeat the stunt of the original, which had set a benchmark of 15 million unit sales within the first year, remains to be seen. It continued to sell more than 152 million units to become the second best-selling Nintendo console of all time, following the Nintendo DS.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Switch\'s record-breaking initial sales were consistent with the high demand that analysts had anticipated. However, the frenzy raised questions as to whether Nintendo could keep up with demand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/walmart-china-shipments-resume-amid-tariff-pressures\">Retailers like Walmart</a></span>, GameStop, Target, and Best Buy were out of the consoles, their websites reported on Wednesday.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In April, Nintendo\'s Bowser, whom the company had been cooperating with \"retail partners to make sure there\'s plenty of supply for not only launch weekend, but far beyond.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed in the same month that 2.2 million Japanese citizens had entered their names into the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 on release day, more than expected and what the company had originally planned to sell to retailers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Kantan Games\' Toto further stated that Japan\'s shortages would likely continue but with smaller effects elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Outside of Japan where demand for Switch 2 is very high, it appears that enthusiasts who badly want the console and are willing to go to the trouble of attempting to acquire one do,\" he said. \"It may be a long wait, but to the extent that supply can be tracked, it appears to be stronger than it was at the launch of the first Switch in 2017.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">President Trump\'s \"reciprocal tariffs\" against almost the entire world also pose threats to the Switch 2. In April, it said it would delay preordering of Switch 2 in the United States until consideration of the impact of tariffs. Switch 2 costs $449 in the United States, and it is the most costly console by Nintendo so far.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nintendo\'s Bowser in April stated that the company was set to \"watch where tariffs are headed\" prior to deciding further price hikes. MST Financial\'s Gibson said a resolution of Trump\'s tariffs and lowered duty rates could cause the Switch 2 prices to fall in the U.S.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Switch 2 is an upgrade of the original Switch, which has a larger screen and enhanced performance. The console also has the new feature of GameChat2, where players can voice or video call gamers online and share game screens.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-17', '01:21:35', 'switch-2-console-launch-breaks-record-with-3-5m-units-sold', 'article/visionaries-network--switch-2-console-launch-sets-new-record.webp', 'Switch 2 Console Launch Breaks Record with 3.5M Units Sold', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network--switch-2-console-launch-sets-new-record.webp', 6, 2025, 'Switch 2, console launch, gaming news, Nintendo, record sales, 2025 games, new console, tech news, video games, hardware launch, Switch sales, Nintendo Switch, gaming industry, console record, 3.5 million units', 'Switch 2 sets a new record with 3.5 million units sold during launch, marking a huge success for Nintendo&rsquo;s latest gaming console.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The American Express Platinum Updates<strong> </strong>will become available later this year, with more travel, dining, and business rewards to meet cardmembers\' evolving needs, especially Millennials and Gen Z.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We introduced the Platinum Card more than 40 years ago, and we\'re introducing it to a whole new generation today,\" said <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/howard-grosfield-711b1ab1/\">Howard Grosfield, Group President, U.S. Consumer Services</a></span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Above all, younger cardmembers are driving usage trends: Gen Z and Millennials made up 35% of total U.S. consumer spend in the fourth quarter. This launch is intended to reward their loyalty and attract the next generation of high-spending, experience-hungry consumers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Lounge Network Grows to New International Hubs</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among the most exciting American Express Platinum Updates<strong> </strong>is the expansion of the company\'s airport lounge network &mdash; now the largest among credit card issuers. Card members can now visit over 1,550 lounges at over 500 airports around the world, including the much-coveted Centurion Lounges.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Three new Centurion Lounges are set to open in Newark (NJ), Salt Lake City (UT), and Tokyo (Japan) within the next year. This will bring the total number of Centurion Lounges to 32, further cementing American Express\'s dominance in travel luxury.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Dining &amp; Hotel Programs Get a Power Boost</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The upgrade also takes advantage of American Express\'s deep food and<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/doordash-acquires-sevenrooms-to-expand-hospitality-crm-tools\"> hospitality</a></span> expertise. On its platform, Resy, Platinum Card Members can reserve a table at over 20,000 restaurants in 30+ countries. The company\'s acquisition of Tock brings an additional 7,000 restaurants, wineries, and venues, continuing to broaden access to one-of-a-kind dining experiences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With hotels, American Express\'s Fine Hotels + Resorts&reg; and The Hotel Collection now consist of 2,600 individually chosen hotels, a number of which are in ideal locations. Benefits of complimentary daily breakfast, experience credits, room upgrades, and assured 4:00 p.m. late check-out at more than 1,600 hotels make this perhaps the most enticing luxury travel program offered by any credit card company.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Business Platinum Benefits for Propelling Growth</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Business Platinum Card is also among the extensive American Express Platinum Updates.

(238, NULL, 'US Warns of Rising Risk from &lsquo;Gas Station Heroin&rsquo; Drug', 'US Sounds Alarm on &lsquo;Gas Station Heroin&rsquo; Drug Risk', 'healthcare and medical devices', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">US health authorities are issuing a warning to consumers regarding a lethal and illegal drug known as gas station heroin, after a sudden upsurge in its consumption has resulted in serious health effects, hospitalization, and deaths.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The substance in question here is tianeptine, which is not licensed by the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/\">United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</a></span> but is typically sold under many different names including Zaza, Tianaa, Pegasus, and TD Red. Such substances are sold at gas stations, smoke shops, and convenience stores and typically marketed as dietary supplements or mood enhancers with little or no mention of the danger involved.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What is Gas Station Heroin?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although it carries a street name that suggests otherwise, gas station heroin is not actually an opioid. It does, however, interact with the same brain receptors as opioids, producing a similar high and addiction. It is used legally as an antidepressant in some countries, but in the United States, it is sold with absolutely no regulation&mdash;and is unsafe to use.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As New Jersey Poison Information and Education System\'s Dr. Diane Calello has described it, \"It\'s kind of this grey area of consumer products or supplements, where the contents are not regulated or tested the way they would be with a medication. You never quite know what\'s in that bottle.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>FDA Issues Stark Warning</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/apyx-medicals-body-contouring-system-cleared-by-fda-for-2025\">FDA</a></span> recently released an official announcement labeling gas station heroin as an emerging health threat, after an increase in adverse events, and urging stricter regulation of the drug. The agency said tianeptine has the potential to lead to serious health effects, such as addiction, overdose, and death&mdash;particularly among young purchasers who may believe such products are safe simply because they can legally be purchased over-the-counter.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"This is a health-threatening and emerging trend,\" the FDA stated. \"Consumers should be aware that these products are a new and serious health threat and should avoid them.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Alarming Health Consequences</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Symptoms of heroin use at a gas station include seizures, near-fatal low blood pressure, fast heart rate, and severe psychological distress. Patients in the majority of cases need to be hospitalized in intensive care. In a single Associated Press report, more than half of 20 recent hospitalizations for tianeptine use needed ICU-level care.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even more alarming is the reality that withdrawal symptoms are also similar to those of opioids, and thus, the drug cessation becomes both physically and emotionally painful.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>State Responses and Poison Control Alerts</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Poison control centers across the country have been flooded with a growing number of tianeptine calls. Alabama saw an astounding 1,400% boost in gas station heroin cases between the years 2018-2021. It wasn\'t until the state imposed some limitations on the drug that cases started to decline.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other nations are also planning to get on the bandwagon as public awareness grows and health hazards mount.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Lack of Regulation Spreads Crisis</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the largest problems with heroin on the market at gas stations is that it is not regulated. The drugs can get around traditional drug regulation by being sold as \"dietary supplements.\" This loophole allows them to be sold as dangerous substances without ever receiving FDA approval or safety testing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Experts are urging lawmakers to fill these gaps in regulation. \"The laws in place just haven\'t kept up with the quick rate at which these hazardous supplements are being marketed and sold,\" said a toxicology specialist close to the crisis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Emergency Call to Action</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rise of gas station heroin is a new frontier in America\'s lengthy war on drug addiction. Though not an opioid, the impact of tianeptine&mdash;and the public health hazard it poses&mdash;are similar to the earlier epidemics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Physicians, poison centers, and advocacy groups increasingly call for stronger labeling bills, public education efforts, and national bans to stem the tide of gas station heroin before it reaches epidemic proportions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The public is also requested not to take any supplement with tianeptine and to report any response to the local poison control center or to the FDA\'s MedWatch program.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-17', '01:38:58', 'us-sounds-alarm-on-gas-station-heroin-drug-risk', 'article/visionaries-network-us-sounds-alarm-on-gas-station-heroin.webp', 'US Sounds Alarm on &lsquo;Gas Station Heroin&rsquo; Drug Risk', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-us-sounds-alarm-on-gas-station-heroin.webp', 6, 2025, 'gas station heroin, drug warning, visionaries network, tianeptine, opioid risk, drug abuse, public health, FDA warning, synthetic drugs, addiction crisis, substance abuse, drug danger, street drugs, legal highs, emerging drugs', 'US health officials warn about the dangers of &lsquo;gas station heroin,&rsquo; a risky drug linked to serious addiction and health threats.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

The phone, which is gold-plated, will be priced at $499, and the mobile plan at $47.45 per month&mdash;a nod to Trump as the 45th and 47th president.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was preceded by stridently nationalistic advertising, asserting the phone is \"made in the United States\" and built for \"hard-working Americans.\" The company also committed to providing U.S.-based customer support and lowering international calling prices to military families.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ethical Issues Resurface</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Critics have already set their sights on the rollout\'s morality. The non-profit watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) criticized the move as \"another example\" of Trump exploiting public office for personal enrichment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"It is surprising that the Trump family has devised yet another way of enriching themselves individually as President,\" said Meghan Faulkner, CREW director of communications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Trump maintains his business ventures are headquartered in a trust managed by his children, experts report that family businesses such as Trump Mobile might be attractive to those who are willing to attempt to please Trump, especially if he is back in office.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Is It Really \"Made in America\"?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Industry experts doubt that Trump-named phones can actually be made in the United States, as the campaign promises. Supply chain and operations professionals hold that smartphone manufacturing in the United States remains economically and logistically improbable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Johns Hopkins Professor Tinglong Dai added further, \"They don\'t even have a working prototype. You\'d need a miracle. The U.S. does not possess the supply chain for complete smartphone manufacturing.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CCS Insight\'s Leo Gebbie concurred in that view, saying, \"It\'s more probable the phone would be assembled in the U.S. out of foreign-sourced components. That\'s as close as they\'ll get to fulfilling the \'Made in America\' promise.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A bustling marketplace awaits</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Trump Mobile moves into a wireless marketplace dominated by telecommunications behemoths AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Industry giants offer comparable monthly plans starting under $40&mdash;a rate that could undercut Trump\'s $47.45 plan.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lower-cost, smaller carriers like Mint Mobile (formerly backed by actor Ryan Reynolds) also compete by offering cheaper prices and flexible plans to sell to niche consumers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Analysts observe that Trump\'s strategy may not be to compete on features or price but to gain political allegiance. The Trump brand has already been responsible for the success of Truth Social and items like Bibles, sneakers, and perfumes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Trump Brand Boom: Profit or Presidency?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2024, Trump reported earning more than $600 million in personal income&mdash;nearly double last year\'s total&mdash;on the strength of increasing demand for branded products. His net worth, Forbes calculated, was valued at $5.1 billion, owing primarily to the valuation of Truth Social and his devoted fan base.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With Trump Mobile, Trump brings a new, politically charged offering into his brand family. How successful the new wireless service depends not only on its technological prowess, but also on the public\'s inclination to embrace the blurring of business and public service lines.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Trump gazes toward making another presidential run, critics argue that efforts of this type muddy the waters between entrepreneurialism and leadership. Whether Trump Mobile is a game-changing telecommunication force or merely another campaign-season sideline business, only time will tell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-18', '11:07:25', 'trump-mobile-launches-499-gold-phone-47-45-plan', 'article/visionaries-network-trump-mobile-launch.webp', 'Trump Mobile Launches $499 Gold Phone &amp; $47.45 Plan', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-trump-mobile-launch.webp', 6, 2025, 'Trump Mobile, gold phone, $499 smartphone, $47.45 plan, Trump phone, visionaries network, conservative, MAGA, new phone launch, affordable plan, mobile service, USA phone, 2025 phone, Trump tech, Trump carrier', 'Trump Mobile debuts a $499 gold smartphone with a patriotic design and a $47.45/month plan, appealing to conservative users.', 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),

The backup windows in the event of a delay are available through 5:38 a.m.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This Starlink 10-18 mission will follow a northeastern trajectory and is another addition to the growing Starlink satellite constellation of SpaceX. Once operational, these satellites will contribute towards improving global internet connectivity, especially in remote and underserved regions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Pristine Weather for Liftoff</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Launch conditions could not be better. The U.S. Space Force 45th Weather Squadron is forecasting a 95% go-for-launch weather, with only the remotest chance of isolated coastal showers possibly producing a few cumulus clouds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This near-flawless prediction is a welcome respite for SpaceX, which has long suffered from the unpredictable weather of Florida. For late-night observers, the clear sky may hold the promise of a stunning night show with the Falcon 9 blasting into the predawn darkness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>No Sonic Booms Anticipated</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unlike some of the SpaceX launches that produce sonic booms heard as returning first-stage, this launch will not produce any in Brevard County. This is because the Falcon 9 first-stage booster will be trying to land on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, about eight minutes after launch.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This sea landing reduces noise for coastal residents and continues SpaceX\'s practice of recovering and recycling rocket parts &mdash; an essential component of its business model and sustainability goal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Whirlwind Week of Space Launches</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The overnight SpaceX launch comes on the heels of a Monday afternoon scrub by the United Launch Alliance (ULA) of a planned Atlas V launch.

The engineers are examining the issue, and no new launch time has been announced yet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the ULA setback, SpaceX is back in the spotlight, reasserting its dominance of the commercial spaceflight industry. The company has been registering a steady pace of Starlink launches, helping to solidify its low-Earth orbit broadband network as global demand for fast and secure internet intensifies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Eyes to the Skies &mdash; and the Future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For space enthusiasts and night owls everywhere, an overnight SpaceX launch late at night is another exciting development in the new era of commercial spaceflight. On the Florida coast or through live online, the launch will be a breathtaking spectacle &mdash; and testament to just how far commercial space travel has come.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If it proceeds on schedule, the mission will further establish the ability of SpaceX\'s Falcon 9 system, its successful drone ship recoveries, and its continued expansion of the Starlink constellation &mdash; a mission Elon Musk hopes will eventually fund missions to Mars.

To reach a top speed of 233 mph and go from 0 to 60 mph in under two seconds&mdash;a performance that places it in the rarest group of performance vehicles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>&ldquo;Here\'s the message we\'re sending to the world in this car,\"</em> Corvette marketing manager Megan Dalley said. <em>\"It\'s the most sophisticated Corvette we\'ve ever made.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Hybrid Power That Packs a Punch</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the core of that is GM\'s new LT7 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 engine, which produces 1,064 horsepower and 828 pound-feet of torque. Supporting the internal combustion drive train is a front-axle-mounted electric motor that contributes 186 horsepower and 145 pound-feet of torque, making the total output a staggering 1,250 horsepower.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This drivetrain hybrid not only enhances in-straight acceleration but also provides all-wheel drive capability, a first on a ZR1. The electric motor is powered by a small battery that is charged through regenerative braking&mdash;no plug-in recharging is necessary.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>\"It combines all that we\'ve learned from the ZR1 and the E-Ray,\"</em> Corvette Chief Engineer Josh Holder said. <em>\"This is the pinnacle expression of high-performance electrification.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Aggressive Styling, Classic Cues</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">ZR1X maintains Corvette\'s aggressive styling cues with the addition of distinctive aerodynamic enhancements, such as a humongous carbon fiber rear wing, active front splitters, and racing-inspired diffusers. A rear \"split window\" treatment on the coupe variant is a nod to the legendary 1963 Corvette Sting Ray.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The car will come in coupe and convertible guise, and will be built at GM\'s Bowling Green Assembly Plant in Kentucky, the site of the Corvette\'s birth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Adding the Corvette Lineup</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X brings the Corvette franchise to five models: Stingray, Z06, E-Ray, ZR1, and now ZR1X. GM has been adamant that it wants Corvette to be a sub-brand within its franchise, and the ZR1X is crucial in making that happen.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While price information hasn\'t been released yet, auto experts expect the ZR1X to start around $200,000, which would make it the most expensive Corvette ever sold.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Road Ahead </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While GM has already teased an all-electric Corvette and even a Corvette SUV, no timeline has been provided. Meanwhile, the ZR1X bridges the gap between gasoline-powered heritage and electrified future&mdash;providing record performance and taking Corvette to new heights.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As its European and Asian rivals scramble to electrify their supercars, the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X is delivering the message that Detroit is not just keeping pace&mdash;it\'s leading the pack.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-19', '11:05:38', 'chevrolet-corvette-zr1x-debuts-as-hybrid-hypercar-king', 'article/visionaries-network-chevrolet-corvette-zrix-debuts-as-hyper-car-king.jpg', 'Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X Unveiled as Hybrid Hypercar King', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-chevrolet-corvette-zrix-debuts-as-hyper-car-king.jpg', 6, 2025, 'Chevrolet, Corvette ZR1X, hybrid hypercar, ZR1X debut, supercar, performance car, electric assist, sports car, visionaries network, Chevy hybrid, luxury car, new Corvette, hypercar specs, fast car, auto news', 'Chevrolet unveils the Corvette ZR1X, a hybrid hypercar blending electric power with V8 performance to claim the crown in 2025&rsquo;s supercar race.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The sale was done when LEA shares were trading at $92.86 a share, placing the focus squarely on insider selling at the world\'s largest auto seating and automotive electronics company.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This action pours gasoline on the fire of discussions regarding Conrad Mallett Lear shares, particularly since Mallett has been a seller, not a buyer, in the last year. Nonetheless, institutional analysts aren\'t ringing the alarm bells yet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>LEA Stock Not Deterred by Insider Trading</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite what others may view as an individual investor red flag, Wall Street is not blinking. Lear\'s fundamentals are strong, and its Q1 2025 report only served to further reinforce investors\' faith. The company\'s profits were good, demonstrating further strength in its seating and electrical systems units.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Analysts still rate LEA a \"Buy,\" and institutions such as JPMorgan have recently raised the stock\'s price targets. The move is a sign Conrad Mallett Lear stock is a good copy, but it doesn\'t necessarily indicate there\'s trouble.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Underappreciated? Metrics Confirm Yes</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you look at Lear\'s numbers, the firm looks very undervalued. At a current price below $93, Lear\'s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 10.68 versus the industry median of 17.48. That amounts to value play potential.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lear\'s price-to-GF-Value is 0.64, which is a definite signal that the stock is far from its intrinsic value, GuruFocus asserts. LEA\'s fair value is approximated at a whopping $145.02&mdash;a huge difference from its existing price, which translates to a possible gain of more than 50%, the platform asserts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To income investors, Lear also offers a decent yield, so it\'s not only a value stock but a dividend stock as well.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conrad Mallett Lear Explains: A Signal or Strategy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/costco-stock-forecast-2025-what-investors-should-expect\">investors</a></span> are cautious of insider selling, particularly if not counterbalanced by insider buying. But as things happen, Conrad Mallett Lear shares appear to be a normal financial deal and not a vote of no confidence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Statistics have revealed the company\'s overall insider trading activity has been neutral with recent buy and sell activity canceling each other out. Furthermore, no institutional dumping of massive size has been witnessed&mdash;another factor that still continues to favor the bullish view of the stock.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Future Ahead for Lear </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Lear is well-placed to capitalize on both the traditional automakers and the electric vehicle mania. Their products are critical components in all vehicles&mdash;gasoline, hybrid, or electric. Since the industry continues to develop, Lear\'s ability to evolve and generate value is becoming more important.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With a market capitalization of $4.87 billion and growing investor interest, the company seems to be poised for long-term expansion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-19', '11:28:21', 'conradmallett-lear-share-sale-sparks-investor-buzz', 'article/visionaries-network-lear-director-canrad-mallett.webp', 'Conradâ€¯Mallett Lear Share Sale Sparks Investor Buzz', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-lear-director-canrad-mallett.webp', 6, 2025, 'Conrad Mallett, Lear Corporation, insider sale, stock sale, $110K, investors, analysts bullish, visionaries network, auto stock, valuation, Q1â€¯2025, P/E low, dividend, JPMorgan, TipRanks', 'Lear director Conradâ€¯Mallett sold $110K in shares at $92.86, yet analysts remain bullish on LEA after strong Q1 results and upgraded outlook.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The malfunction is caused by a defective brake pedal pivot pin that was not securely fastened at the time of production.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The defective vehicles are 2023&ndash;2025 Honda Pilots, 2021&ndash;2025 Acura TLX, and 2023&ndash;2025 Acura MDX.

Danny Boyle helms and Alex Garland pens the third and most terrifying Rage Virus installment, set about 28 years post-original outbreak that redefined the zombie genre.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A sequel to 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007), 28 Years Later returns audiences to a post-apocalyptic England overrun by casualties of the virus that threatened to destroy humanity. But this time, the danger is no longer merely biological &mdash; it\'s emotional, political, and uncomfortably human.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Plot: A Virus Never Really Dies</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/28_Years_Later\">28 Years Later</a></span> story is the next generation of the world existing in the aftermath of the Rage Virus. While most of the infected have since perished, their influence continues to be felt in social trauma and radical elements, which have filled the power vacuum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When news of the latest viral mutation breaks in Scotland, government agencies move into high gear. The last survivors of the initial outbreak are compelled to relive their pasts, and new characters enter the scene &mdash; many of whom have never experienced the initial chaos themselves.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This is not a zombie film but a film about control, survival, fear, and the intergenerational impact of disaster.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Return of the Original Visionaries</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The years of waiting are over for the fans. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland, the duo that initiated the franchise with the groundbreaking 28 Days Later, are back together at the helm. Their partnership brought to life one of the most recognizable horror films of the 21st century, and their reunion makes 28 Years Later an immediate film event.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Boyle\'s unique visual style &mdash; dramatic lighting, frantic camera work, and unvarnished emotional performances &mdash; is wedded to Garland\'s economical, witty scriptwriting. The outcome? A film that\'s half-thrilling, half-philosophical, with adrenaline-fueled action weighed against existential dread.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Their goal was not solely to <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/halon-entertainment-expands-to-scotland-million-studio\">entertain</a></span>, but to explore how society continues &mdash; or disintegrates &mdash; in the aftermath of trauma.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Who\'s Starring?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though Cillian Murphy\'s participation is on the down-low, the movie has a combination of experienced and new actors. The best performances are delivered by up-and-coming British actors who provide depth and realism to their characters. The casting of the movie has been lauded for its realism and earthy performances &mdash; making the horror all-too-real and setting it right at home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Every actor portrays the psychological burden of existing in an imperfect world &mdash; either they are peacekeepers attempting to rebuild society or extremists attempting to dismantle it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why It Matters in 2025</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The 28 Years Later movie release is during a period when international viewers are still reeling from the effects of real pandemics. The subject matter of fear, misinformation, failed leadership, and individual versus mass survival in the film has more relevance than ever before.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s not only a horror movie &mdash; it\'s a cultural commentary. Boyle and Garland employ the virus as a symbol of division, illustrating to us that the greatest threat to humanity is not the infected, but humanity itself.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It has already been criticized as \"the most cerebral zombie movie in decades\" and \"a powerful, pulse-pounding return to dystopian horror.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The 28 Years Later movie release is a fulfillment on all levels &mdash; tension, intelligence, and soul. It conveys the fear of the unknown, the sadness of survival, and the vulnerability of order in a world one step from destruction. Whether you\'re a die-hard fan or a new fan of the franchise, this film is well worth seeing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Out on June 20, the audience everywhere will once again be taken into the terrifying world of the Rage Virus &mdash; to discover that the scariest monsters are maybe not the infected.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-20', '00:41:39', '28-years-later-movie-release-sparks-new-horror-frenzy', 'article/visionaries-network-28-years-later-movie-release-sparks-new-horror.webp', '28 Years Later Movie Release Sparks New Horror Frenzy', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-28-years-later-movie-release-sparks-new-horror.webp', 6, 2025, '28 Years Later movie, 28 Years Later release, new horror movie 2025, 28 Days Later sequel, horror film 2025, 28 Years Later trailer, zombie movie 2025, horror movie buzz', 'The highly anticipated 28 Years Later movie has been released, sparking a fresh wave of excitement in the horror community.

Their answers reinforce one basic truth: clarity, communication, and empathy are the secrets to being an excellent leader &mdash; especially in the unexpected.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Leadership Matters More in Times of Uncertainty</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether economic turmoil, sector transformation, or global disruption, uncertainty is part of the modern workplace. Employee engagement has hit an all-time low over the last ten years, according to a Gallup report, largely fueled by confusion, poor communication, and fear of losing one\'s job.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That&rsquo;s why learning how to motivate your team during uncertainty is no longer optional &mdash; it\'s mission-critical.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>1. Transparency and Trust Take Charge</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">StevenDouglas Managing Director Laurie Canepa feels no one expects teams to have perfect leaders &mdash; they just want honesty.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;No one wishes to work in a situation where there is uncertainty or fear,&rdquo; she claims. \"You want the staff to understand that you\'re being truthful to them about the situation and continually seeking solutions.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Her plan is a simple but powerful ritual: one \"win\" every Friday, however small, contributed by each member of her staff. She posts them openly on LinkedIn, reinforcing optimism and giving employees tangible moments of pride.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>2. Focus on What\'s Controllable</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jennifer Carlson, Robert Half\'s Region Director, VP, says that simplicity is what combats the feeling of being overwhelmed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We manage our attitude and our production,\" she reminds her staff. \"Simplifying things and being positive keeps everyone moving.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By focusing on achievable goals and incremental progress, Carlson shifts the dialogue from fear to empowerment &mdash; a sound strategy where long-term vision is not an option.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>3. Communication Brings Calm</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Karen Vineyard, Bank of America\'s Market Executive, is a strong advocate of overcommunication.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I stay calm and work on keeping my employees\' minds on what they can control,\" she continues. \"I try to over-communicate to them and get them to over-communicate to our customers.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With over 54% of American employees suffering from severe stress due to job insecurity (APA), frequent updates and open-door policies ensure the psychological safety necessary for teams to stay motivated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>4. Create a Culture that Seeks to Change</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hillary Spreizer, CEO of The Latitude Group, leans into the chaos.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Chaos is the new normal,\" she says. \"So, it\'s helpful to point that out and find stability somewhere else.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">She emphasizes accountability, quantifiable objectives, and a resilient team mentality. She has a company culture that accepts ambiguity but responds to it with clarity of expectations &mdash; a shrewd tactic, given that Gallup research indicates that only 50% of employees today have a clear understanding of what\'s expected of them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>5. Shared Rituals Sustain Resilience</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Traci Schweikert, founder of Talent Engagement Strategies, believes resilience is learned, not born.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a period of utmost stress, she began weekly sessions and exercised total openness &mdash; even when all the answers were missing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Slack \"High-Five Fridays\" complete with shoutouts and meme parades were staff favorites. \"It\'s fun and reminds us we\'re doing this together,\" she adds.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>6. Stay Present and Purposeful</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Simply Home CEO Ashley Wainscott keeps her employees grounded with frequent compliments and intent that faces outward.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Weekly meetings that are based on weekly small wins keep the momentum going,\" she says. \"And volunteer work keeps us focused on what we can give back in the world.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When employees feel they are serving something bigger than themselves, they create meaning that transcends the day-to-day stress.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>7. Step Back to See Forward</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Janna Paulson, President of Peel Paulson Design Studio, suggests a physical reboot can refresh staff attitude.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We recently returned from a company retreat in San Antonio.

The pilot, launched this week with modest fanfare, is a significant milestone toward Elon Musk\'s dream of a world without drivers. The first riders? Social media personalities and online content creators, specially selected to clog the internet with first impressions and going-viral content.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Tesla Robotaxi service is operating in limited mode. Through a small fleet of specially outfitted Model Y vehicles, the rides are geofenced to a specific region of Austin, and invite-only riders can take them now. The vehicles are equipped with Tesla\'s new Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and camera-based autonomy&mdash;still, however, a human safety net. A Tesla safety monitor is on board every vehicle for this pilot mode.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite its celebrity status, Tesla is entering a field already populated. Alphabet\'s Waymo already has a fleet of fully autonomous taxis plying the streets since 2018, most recently in Phoenix, Arizona. The only catch? Waymo employs radar and lidar sensors, while Tesla has chosen to be \"vision-only,\" using cameras and neural networks. Some safety experts have panned the move, especially given Tesla\'s accident history and the U.S. auto safety agency\'s current probes into its autonomous claims.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But Musk is hopeful. In a congratulatory tweet on X (formerly Twitter), he teased:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Massive congrats to the @Tesla_AI chip design &amp; software teams on a tremendous @Robotaxi launch!!! Ten years of hard work coming to fruition. Both chip and AI software teams were built from the ground up at Tesla.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One thing that caught people\'s attention? The fixed price point&mdash;$4.20. Whether it\'s a sarcastic comment or a publicity stunt, Musk never disappoints.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What is a Robotaxi?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tesla Robotaxi service is Musk\'s grander vision: a future with self-driving <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../magazine/profile/ev-electra-wins-a-spot-in-the-top-business-leaders-awards-2025\">electric taxis</a></span> reducing traffic, pollution, and accidents. All Robotaxis are based on the Model Y platform and come with Tesla\'s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) software bundle to navigate roads.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Waymo or Cruise uses costly lidar systems like everybody else\'s autonomous vehicles, Tesla\'s uses only cameras and AI processing. Although this has been controversial, especially under tough circumstances like rain, fog, or dark alleys, this has kept Tesla\'s prices much lower.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Federal authorities are observing closely. In fact, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is requesting more details regarding how Tesla\'s autonomous systems react in real-world environments, particularly after previous crashes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How Does the Tesla Robotaxi Work?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are just 10&ndash;20 Tesla Robotaxis in Austin. Operation is 6 AM to midnight, excluding highways, airports, and weather-impacted zones. You must have an invitation as an eligible user to have access to the system.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When Robotaxi goes public, riders will simply need to download a specific app. Taking a ride will be similar to Uber or Lyft&mdash;put in a destination, receive an estimated fare and wait time, and monitor your ride in real-time. When the vehicle pulls up, users simply match the license plate number, enter the vehicle, and click \"Start\" through the app to start.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aboard, passengers can customize the ride by tweaking climate control, seat position, and even music&mdash;all via app or touchscreen. Riders can call for help or make the vehicle pull over or stop in case help is needed. After the ride, passengers exit, close the doors, and offer their feedback&mdash;all through the app interface.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-24', '00:41:42', 'tesla-robotaxi-service-launches-in-austin-with-limited-access', 'article/visionaries-network-tesla-robotaxi-services-launches-in-austin.webp', 'Tesla Robotaxi Service Launches in Austin with Limited Access', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-tesla-robotaxi-services-launches-in-austin.webp', 6, 2025, 'Tesla Robotaxi, Austin Robotaxi launch, Tesla autonomous service, visionaries network, self-driving taxi Austin, Tesla Robotaxi limited access, autonomous vehicle service, Tesla news 2025', 'Tesla has officially launched its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with limited access for select users.

Hideo Kojima\'s ambitious follow-up takes up where Sam Bridges left off in the 2019 Death Stranding. While the game itself is only releasing on PlayStation 5, however, lots of PC gamers are left wondering: Will Death Stranding 2 be ported to PC?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While no official confirmation has been issued, all signs point to yes. Kojima Productions has a history of releasing its signature titles on PC after a short exclusivity period on PlayStation. Not only does this increase the game\'s consumer base, but this also taps into a massive PC gaming market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Back: The First Port</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To estimate the possibility of a Death Stranding 2 PC port, we should consider what happened to the first title. Launched in November 2019 as a PS4 exclusive game, Death Stranding saw the light of day on PC in July 2020&mdash;eight months later.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The PC version was also well-received, with improved graphics, improved frame rates, and bonus material, like fantastic crossovers with other games. It also brought the game to an entirely new generation of individuals, many of whom had never experienced the innovative, genre-defying gameplay.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This successful porting venture has provided a solid foundation for the sequel.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Will Death Stranding 2 come to PC?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So far, no official statement of a Death Stranding 2 PC release by Kojima Productions or Sony has been made. That being said, given industry practice and past precedent, it\'s probably a certainty. PlayStation does negotiate timed exclusivity in major titles, but they always seem to come to PC.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Both the fans and critics have the view that the same pattern will be repeated for Death Stranding 2. The game will be PS5 exclusive for some months&mdash;six to eight months&mdash;before appearing on PC platforms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Predicted Release Date for PC </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If Death Stranding 2 maintains the same timeline as the original, then a PC launch would be imminent in the first half of 2026. The February or March 2026 launch window would give PlayStation enough time to savor the exclusive sales while also giving Kojima Productions enough time to refine the game for PC players.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While this date is speculative, most insiders believe that development on the PC version is already happening in parallel with the PS5 version.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How the PC Port Makes Sense</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There are some solid reasons to release a Death Stranding 2 PC port:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Market demand:</strong> PC gaming has never been more popular. To be outside this market would be folly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Proven success:</strong> The initial PC port was a critical and commercial success, demonstrating that there\'s a hungry audience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Partnerships secured:</strong> Kojima Productions had previously secured a partnership with 505 Games for the initial PC release, so a second partnership is highly probable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, PC ports typically include bonus content, improved graphics, and mod support&mdash;elements that only help to make the PC port more attractive to hardcore gamers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the Death Stranding 2 PC version has not been officially announced yet, all the signs are pointing in that direction. History, customer demand, and dev intent all suggest it is a matter of when, not if, Sam Bridges walks onto PC screens once again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/live-streaming-technology-in-online-casinos-transforms-gaming\">Gamers</a></span> who wish to play on PC will have to wait until sometime early in 2026.

The move prompted a surprise selloff in Hims\' shares of the online health firm, with Hims stock plunges over 20% on Monday &mdash; its largest decline in over two years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The fallout is due to increasing controversy from the sale of compounded versions of semaglutide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Novo\'s incredibly successful obesity drug Wegovy. While Hims has insisted that it never actually sold compounded semaglutide directly, the increasing scrutiny regarding telehealth platforms supposedly selling unapproved versions led Novo Nordisk to end the partnership.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Novo Walks Away Over Compounded Drug Issues</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Novo Nordisk, the maker of both Ozempic and Wegovy, has been particularly vocal in its criticism of compounded semaglutide &mdash; <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/alembic-pharmaceuticals-wins-usfda-approval-for-pantoprazole-injection\">pharmacy</a></span>-produced copies by pharmacies when name-brand products are in short supply. Compounded products are not FDA-approved and their safety and effectiveness are uncertain.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Hims had partnered with Novo to sell Wegovy on its online prescription platform, the increasing legal gray area in the sale of weight-loss pills might have been too perilous for the drug giant. Analysts speculate that Novo shifted to protect its brand image, avoiding any online platform associated with unscrupulous or non-FDA-approved drug sales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a release, Novo Nordisk said the move was part of its global effort to enable responsible patient access to its medicines. Hims, however, claimed that it does not sell or distribute compounded drugs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Hims stock plunges over 20%: A Blow to Investor Sentiment</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wall Street responded hastily to this split. Hims stock plunges over 20%, sending shockwaves through the health tech and investor communities. The investors had been relying on the company\'s for-profit entry into the GLP-1 weight-loss drug market as a source of future capital. The loss of Novo\'s support now threatens those plans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This sudden drop is reflective of broader doubt about Hims\' growth strategy. While the company has done well in categories like men\'s wellness, skin health, and mental health treatments, weight-loss medications were meant to be a game-changer &mdash; possibly catapulting Hims to a new level of high-margin pharma products.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Experts now argue over whether the firm jumped so quickly into the highly regulated sector without adequate oversight or strategic protection.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next for Hims &amp; Hers?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the glitch, the management at Hims insists that the company remains robust. In a public statement following the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/costco-stock-forecast-2025-what-investors-should-expect\">stock</a></span> drop, the company reaffirmed that it will continue pursuing partnerships that are aligned with regulations and standards of patient safety. It also referenced its expanding product line and user base as signs of robustness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But the week\'s most significant story has been Hims stock plunges over 20%, showing how quickly public opinion can shift. It\'s an age in which health care and technology become more and more entwined, and trust, compliance, and transparency are essential. The market for weight-loss drugs may be lucrative, but it\'s also full of legal risk that can make or break a partnership &mdash; and a stock price.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Going forward, Hims must restore investor and consumer confidence. That will mean clearly stating its stances on compounded medications, complying with all FDA guidelines, and perhaps reforming how it approaches high-risk pharma classes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The loss of the Wegovy deal is a short-term loss, but how Hims acts over the next several weeks will be whether it can bounce back &mdash; or whether this 20% drop is the start of a more extended downturn.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-25', '00:25:27', 'hims-stock-plunges-over-20-after-wegovy-deal-collapses', 'article/visionariesnetwork-hims-stock-plunges-over-twenty-percent.webp', 'Hims stock plunges over 20% after Wegovy deal collapses', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionariesnetwork-hims-stock-plunges-over-twenty-percent.webp', 6, 2025, 'Hims stock, Wegovy deal, Hims &amp; Hers Health, stock market news, visionaries network, HIMS share price, Wegovy collapse, biotech stocks, healthcare stocks, HIMS news', 'Hims &amp; Hers Health Inc. shares dropped over 20% after its anticipated deal involving weight-loss drug Wegovy collapsed, raising investor concerns about future growth prospects.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Bezos\' and Sanchez\' three-day wedding will be held between June 26 and June 28 on Italy\'s island of San Giorgio off Venice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As much as the wedding has made international headlines over its A-list guest list, it has also unleashed a frenzy of local outrage, leading to what has become the Bezos Venice wedding protest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>San Giorgio Island Transformed into Exclusive Venue</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The newlywed couple has allegedly rented the whole island for their VIP party, with over 200 A-listers in attendance. Guests will be on Bezos\' $500 million yacht, Koru, during the partying, making a spectacle that has further infuriated many Venetians. They say the wedding is a symbol of the growing divide between the super-rich and ordinary people&mdash;and they\'re protesting in the streets to have their say.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Activists Trigger a Public Uproar</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On June 23, protesters from organizations like Greenpeace and \"Everyone Hates Elon\" made their point clear and loud. They rolled out a giant placard in St Mark\'s Square addressed to Bezos and demanding that billionaires be taxed. Their protest is part of a larger movement that is unfolding in the city, the Bezos Venice wedding protest, condemning not only the single person, but a system that permits gargantuan wealth to dominate public life.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>\"No Space for Bezos\": The Local Resistance</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another outspoken group, \"No Space for Bezos,\" has started protesting against what they describe as the \"privatization of Venice.\" They think that the billionaire is turning the old town into his personal party zone. Protester Alice Bazzoli told local media, \"He is going to use the whole city like a private ballroom, as a private event space, as if the citizens are not there.\" Protesters have also criticized <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/amazon-retail-chief-stresses-balance-between-cost-cutting-and-innovation\">Amazon</a></span> for destroying small businesses and exploiting workers, stoking a highly charged atmosphere.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>More than a Wedding: A Fight for Equality </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the demonstrators explained to Reuters, \"The issue is not the wedding. The issue is the system. We believe that it is not possible for one billionaire to lease a city to play with.\" There were others who mentioned the tax rate of Bezos, which was said to be as low as 1.1%, and questioned how someone so affluent could give back so little to society.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>City Officials Defend the Glamorous Affair</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the criticism, local politicians are embracing the celebrity wedding. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro and Veneto Governor Luca Zaia both jumped to defend the wedding, describing it as an economic bonanza for the city. Zaia estimated the wedding to add between &euro;20 to &euro;30 million to the regional economy, a boost in revenue for hotels, caterers, and gondola companies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A City Grappling with Fame and Frustration</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But these promises have not been enough to quiet the Bezos Venice wedding protest. The locals remain concerned that such high-end events make it appear acceptable for Venice to be a high-end playground for the wealthy, not a living city with real people, culture, and struggles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>More Than A Wedding &mdash; A Symbolic Divide </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The growing protest movement is an indication of Venice\'s constant fight against commercialization, overtourism, and cultural erosion. While some see Bezos\' wedding as a lavish love party, others see it as a bitter reminder of elitism and inequality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As wedding dates approach, it is clear that Venice will not only be hosting an amazing wedding but also a significant public discourse on money, space, and power.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-25', '00:31:06', 'bezos-venice-wedding-protest-draws-global-attention', 'article/visionaries-network-bezos-venice-wedding-protest-draws.webp', 'Bezos Venice Wedding Protest Sparks Global Attention', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-bezos-venice-wedding-protest-draws.webp', 6, 2025, 'Jeff Bezos wedding, Venice protest, Bezos wedding protest, climate protest Venice, Bezos news, billionaire wedding, environmental protest, Bezos Venice, Jeff Bezos 2025', 'Jeff Bezos&rsquo; lavish wedding in Venice faced environmental protests that drew global media coverage, spotlighting concerns over climate impact and billionaire extravagance.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Ultimately, efforts to align our costs with unit demand were not successful, and the partnership was no longer viable for us.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why McDonald\'s Krispy Kreme Doughnut Removal Happened</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While pilot tests were successful and even better than expected in the initial stages, the same did not happen when the scale increased. Demand at a larger scale failed to live up to expectations, and the costs remained too high to be justifiable, according to an Associated Press report.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">McDonald\'s has seemingly experienced supply chain and logistics problems with keeping a consistent supply of Krispy Kreme doughnuts. In the meantime, Krispy Kreme was unable to keep operational costs in line with the amount of sales they gained.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Therefore, McDonald\'s Krispy Kreme doughnut removal was the most sensible next move for both companies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next for Both Brands</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Krispy Kreme is now set to return to expanding its own branded distribution system. The company has been expanding its retail store and convenience store base and is likely to double down on that.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Meanwhile, McDonald\'s is going back to basics and will revamp its breakfast. Although demand for breakfast items remains strong among consumers, the chain feels more secure in tweaking such classics as Egg McMuffins and hash browns than experimenting with new dessert partnerships.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Customer Reaction to Krispy Kreme Withdrawal</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On Twitter, the reaction was mixed. Some loyal customers were irritated at the disappearance of a convenient pickup point for their favorite doughnuts, but others were not.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>One of Twitter (formerly X) users penned:</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Never gonna make it long.

With this new command-line interface, developers can now write, debug, and manage code using natural language instead of technical syntax &mdash; all from the terminal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its global launch is seen as Google\'s ambitious foray into the aggressive market of AI code assistant competitors like OpenAI\'s Codex and Anthropic\'s Claude Code. However, what makes Gemini CLI stand out is that it emphasizes transparency and accessibility.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Coding With Conversations</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before, terminal work was always a set of specific commands and programming code. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://gemini.google/about/?hl=en-IN\">Gemini CLI</a></span> eliminates that by simply allowing users to tell it what they wish to do in plain English. From creating site templates to debugging or automating, the tool accepts natural language inputs and converts them into code.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Instead of learning particular commands by heart, programmers can now just talk to their terminal like they talk to their coworker,\" explained Google Senior Staff Software Engineer Taylor Mullen. \"It\'s about making coding easier and faster.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Open Source for Everybody</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the most unique aspects of Gemini CLI is that it is open-source. Developers can get at the code, customize it to fit particular requirements, or help make it better. This is a departure from how Google did things before, trending towards the open community rather than having powerful AI tools trapped in corporate silos.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By going open source, Google hopes to make available not only veteran developers but also students, solo developers, and tech hobbyists who might otherwise not have been able to access the like.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Founded on Gemini AI\'s Power</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The feature is one of a broader family of Gemini products Google has been releasing throughout the past year. The company unveiled Gemma, its set of open large language models, earlier in 2024, followed by Gemini AI integration into Google Docs, among other applications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With Gemini CLI, that same intelligence now comes to the command line. It brings activities like code explanations, documentation generation, and project management, and even content generation like blog drafts or video scripts &mdash; all from the developer\'s command terminal of choice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Individual Google account owners are offered free access to the Gemini Code Assist level tier, up to 1,000 requests per day. Additional limits are offered for a fee, for professional developers and enterprise teams.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Designed for Creators and Developers Both</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even though its main function is designed for software developers, Gemini CLI is general in nature. Freelancers, artists, and bloggers may use its features. It can be employed to draft technical guides, build landing pages, and automate routine digital tasks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"AI tools such as this will be included in every creative process in the near future,\" <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanjsalva/\">Google\'s Senior Director of Product Ryan J. Salva</a></span> stated. \"Whether you are coding, writing, or designing, having a tool like Gemini CLI alongside you can enable you to accomplish more in a shorter amount of time.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Glimpse of the Future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Google\'s Gemini CLI release is an indicator of the tech giant\'s commitment to making AI more accessible and inclusive. While other software requires steep learning curves, this assistant simplifies things for more individuals.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By bringing the best of conversational AI to the command line, Gemini CLI is a vision of the future where coding is more problem-solving and creativity. and less memorization.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As developers begin to experiment with this tool, it becomes clear that natural language interfaces are the way forward. And with its open-source origins and strong AI backing, Gemini CLI could well become the go-to for today\'s developers in the near future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-27', '00:35:49', 'google-launches-gemini-cli-for-easier-ai-powered-coding', 'article/visionaries-network-google-launches-gemini-cli.webp', 'Google Launches Geminiâ€¯CLI: AI-Powered Coding from the Command Line', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-google-launches-gemini-cli.webp', 6, 2025, 'Google Gemini CLI, Gemini Code Assist, AI coding tool, Gemini 2.5 Pro, openâ€‘source CLI, developer AI assistant, commandâ€‘line AI, visionaries network', 'Google has introduced Geminiâ€¯CLI, an open-source command-line interface powered by the Geminiâ€¯2.5â€¯Pro AI model.

(255, '', 'Nike Plans Price Hike in US After Weak Q4 Sales | Visionaries Network', 'Nike Price Hike in US Planned After Weak Q4 Sales', 'brand management digital marketing and business', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">US sportswear behemoth Nike is to face strategic restructuring including a&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/where-to-buy-kobe-6-protro-dodgers-2025-full-guide\">Nike</a></span> price hike in US, after a disastrous fourth quarter in fiscal year 2025. The firm posted a 14% drop in year-over-year direct sales and an eye-watering 26% fall in internet sales, and management reacted with cost control measures, product restaging, and judicious price increases.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nike\'s fiscal quarter runs from May 31 to June 1, and the March&ndash;May quarter closed with total revenue 12% lower year on year at $11.1 billion. In North America, Q4 revenue was 11% down, and in EMEA it was 10% down. Greater China, comprising China, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, saw sales decline 20%, though CEO Elliot Hill explained that it was \"largely in line with our plan.\".</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite this fall, Nike managed to surpass analyst expectations, with revenue and earnings per share (EPS) coming in 3.74% and 16.67% above projections, respectively. This led to Nike <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/hims-stock-plunges-over-20-after-wegovy-deal-collapses\">stock</a></span> rising 10% in after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange as an expression of cautious investor optimism.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>CEO Hill Oversees Strategic Turnaround</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliotthillnike/\">CEO of Nike, Elliot Hill,</a></span> who emerged from retirement in October 2024, is spearheading a full-scale revival of the brand after previous mishaps, including pruning wholesale relationships and emphasizing lifestyle products at the expense of performance products.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Today, the company is repositioning in core sporting goods, investing in retail relationships, and adding new product lines. Hill characterized the new strategy as being based on what he calls a \"sport offense\" to establish more engaging relationships with athletes, fuel innovation, and differentiate itself in a competitive marketplace.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We\'re organizing ourselves into a sports offense to have a more intimate relationship with the athletes we service,\" Hill told analysts, &ldquo;To better know them, to drive sports-specific innovation, to tell great stories and differentiate ourselves in the marketplace.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Nike price hike in US Begins Fall 2025</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most important of all is price hikes on certain footwear lines in the US starting fall 2025. Nike price hike in US is supported by a broader plan to insulate profit margins from the increasing cost of production&mdash;specifically those resulting from new US tariffs on Chinese imports, now imposed by the Trump administration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Hill described the price increases as \"surgical,\" part of Nike\'s seasonal strategy. While some of the cost will be shared with retail partners and absorbed by suppliers, consumers will see higher price tags on some models in stores this fall.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Supply Chain Adjustments and Tariff Relief</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">China, which accounts for about 16% of Nike\'s US footwear imports, is also part of Nike\'s evolving strategy. Nike aims to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing by the end of fiscal 2026 by working to get down to the high single-digit percentage range. The move will guard against higher tariffs without harming Nike\'s global supply chain efficiency.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, Hill pointed out that China will be one of the key centers for Nike\'s global business, although US-market production will be relocated to less-tariff-affected nations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As estimated by CFO Matt Friend, the tariff cost impact would be $1 billion, with a 75-basis point gross margin impact for fiscal 2026&mdash;mostly in the first half.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Other Significant Developments: Inventory, Partnerships, and Delays in Women\'s Line</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to the price and supply realignments, Nike is also working to rid inventories, with a 0.4% reduction seen last quarter. Nike is also rebuilding relationships with major merchants such as Amazon by introducing a stand-alone Nike store on the platform.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But all is not well in the company. NikeSkims, the much-awaited line by Kim Kardashian, was delayed due to production issues, which slowed down the momentum on Nike\'s women\'s product business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Future: A Page Turning Moment </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the disappointments of today, Hill is sure that Nike\'s repositioning will pay off in the end. \"Where we sit, we believe our business is going to begin to improve. It\'s time to turn the page,\" he explained to shareholders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Nike price hike in US looms to take effect, and in renewed emphasis on sporting performance, retail alliances, and innovation, the company is wagering on a slimmed-down, agile future to ride out economic downturns and stiff competition in the worldwide sportswear industry.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-06-29', '23:11:35', 'nike-price-hike-in-us-planned-after-weak-q4-sales', 'article/visionaries-network-nike-price-hike.webp', 'Nike Price Hike in US Planned After Weak Q4 Sales', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-nike-price-hike.webp', 6, 2025, 'Nike price hike 2025, Nike Q4 earnings report, Nike price increase USA, visionaries network, Nike footwear price hike, Nike apparel pricing strategy', 'Nike is set to raise prices across select U.S. footwear and apparel starting Fall 2025 after reporting weak Q4 sales and facing $1 billion in expected tariff costs.

Say hello to the Ferrari Amalfi, a completely new 2+ roadster coupe that supersedes the popular Roma. Designed with the stunning Amalfi Coast in mind and crafted with revolutionary innovation, the Amalfi not only propels Ferrari\'s heritage forward &mdash; it takes it to new heights.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Timeless Style with a Contemporary Twist</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Designed under the visionary leadership of Flavio Manzoni, the Ferrari Amalfi exterior embodies sculptural grace. The front end introduces a bold change &mdash; the iconic grille is replaced by a smooth, body-colored floating wing that enhances aerodynamic efficiency. Sleek headlamps and a sharper lower splitter give the car a wider, more aggressive look.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the back, discreet references to Ferrari\'s past intersect with contemporary minimalism. Concealed tail lamps recall vintage styling, as the broad rear diffuser emphasizes serious aerodynamics. The Verde Costiera livery &mdash; a bright teal color inspired by the Amalfi Coast &mdash; bestows sculpted bodywork with blinding gloss in sunlight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Cabin for the 21st Century Motorist</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Internally, the cabin is an entirely new interpretation of Ferrari\'s grand tourer philosophy. Borrowing a page from the 12Cilindri, the dashboard is configured with a monolithic shape with the digital cluster and air vents merging into a single aerodynamic surface.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The anodised aluminium centre tunnel appears to be suspended, housing the gear selector, wireless charging tray, and key controls. Side sail-style door grips cover the dual-cockpit configuration and form a tight yet performance-oriented cockpit for passenger and driver.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Optional comfort seats come in three sizes and feature massage and ventilation systems. Long road trips are downright luxurious with five programmable massage modes and three intensity levels. And if your navigator is the music, the optional Burmester 14-speaker system with 1,200 watts of power delivers symphony-quality sound at any pace.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Aerodynamics in Motion</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What sets the Ferrari Amalfi apart as a truly pioneering <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/byd-beats-tesla-in-europe-april-2025-as-ev-leader-shifts\">automobile</a></span> is its dynamic aerodynamic design. The rear active mobile wing is dynamic and varies in real time to match driving conditions and has three drive modes: Low Drag, Medium Downforce, and High Downforce.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether slicing through coastal switchbacks or tearing it up on the autobahn, the wing optimizes downforce and stability. It\'s a great example of how design and technology come together to bring out the best in the driver.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Built for Performance, Engineered for Versatility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beneath the bonnet, the Ferrari Amalfi boasts a twin-turbo V8 engine that has been re-tuned to produce 631 horsepower.

Following months of rumors and teasers, the latest device has been launched as the company\'s very first true flagship, which contains major upgrades in terms of design, performance, and software.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nothing Phone 3 launch brings a fresh approach to phone design with extreme design revamps on the back panel and numerous hardware and software enhancements. The phone retails at â‚¹79,999 for the 256GB model and is set to disrupt the conventional premium players such as Samsung and Apple, but adhering to Nothing\'s distinctive design philosophy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Revamped Design: Essential Key, Glyph Matrix, and More</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nothing Phone 3 maintains the minimalist aesthetic of the company but introduces several new features that are immediately apparent. One of the most obvious is the new Glyph Matrix, which is home to 489 addressable LEDs, more useful than ever before. Users are able to personalize glyphs for various notifications, charging statuses, and even app-specific notifications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is also an important addition in the form of the Essential Key, which is a side hardware button that is programmable. The user can set shortcuts to launch apps, turn on the flashlight, or turn on silent mode &mdash; a personalizing feature that is not usually available on mainstream smartphones.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The new camera island deviates from the conventional positions, and this allows the back panel to have a contemporary and streamlined appearance. Very narrow bezels that are only 1.87mm wide along the screen facilitate an immersive viewing experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Display and Performance: Flagship-Class Power</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nothing Phone 3 features a stunning 6.67-inch bendable AMOLED display with a maximum of 4500 nits of peak brightness and a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate for stunning display in any environment. From gaming, streaming, to web surfing, the screen offers state-of-the-art quality with vibrant colors and deep blacks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Internally, Nothing Phone 3 is powered by Qualcomm\'s Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chipset, manufactured on a 4nm process by TSMC. The octa-core chipset is clocked at up to 3.21GHz and powered by an Adreno 825 GPU to deliver stunning graphics performance. The onboard Hexagon NPU handles AI processing aside from image optimization and intelligent power management.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nothing promises a stunning performance jump over the previous generation, making the Phone 3 perfect for heavy gaming, multitasking, and pro-level photography.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Triple 50MP Camera System: Imaging All-Round</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cameras have been at the forefront of smartphone innovation, and Nothing Phone 3 does that beautifully in that aspect.

The once-dominant player in canned fruits and vegetables has announced that it is entering a court-supervised restructuring and sale process, marking a significant turn for a brand that has fed American families for generations. The Del Monte bankruptcy underscores the severe impact of mounting debt, shifting consumer behavior, and pandemic-era miscalculations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to a statement released by CEO Greg Longstreet, the company is aiming to use Chapter 11 protection to stabilize its finances and transition to new ownership. &ldquo;After a thorough evaluation of all available options, we determined that a court-supervised sale process is the most effective way to accelerate our turnaround and create a stronger and more enduring Del Monte Foods,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Company to Continue Operations During Bankruptcy Process</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the Del Monte bankruptcy filing, the company will continue normal operations through the peak canning season. Thanks to a new $912.5 million debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan, the company is expected to meet payroll, pay suppliers, and fulfill customer orders without interruption. This funding gives Del Monte the necessary breathing room to restructure while maintaining day-to-day business continuity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Court documents filed in the bankruptcy court reveal the company holds liabilities between $1 billion and $10 billion. The massive financial strain stems from a combination of poor inventory management, soaring interest payments, and changing market dynamics.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Pandemic Demand Surge Led to Oversupply</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Del Monte Foods experienced a spike in sales as consumers rushed to stock up on non-perishable pantry staples. The company responded by boosting production to meet the demand. However, as consumer habits normalized, Del Monte was left with excessive inventory that eventually had to be marked down or written off.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Del Monte bankruptcy filing details how this oversupply severely impacted profitability. The company stated that it was forced to &ldquo;sell at substantial losses&rdquo; and absorb significant storage and logistics costs as a result of overproduction.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Rising Debt and Interest Rates Made Matters Worse</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Another key factor behind the Del Monte bankruptcy is its growing debt burden. Del Monte Pacific Limited acquired the U.S. division of the company in 2014, relying heavily on borrowed capital to complete the deal. Since then, the company has struggled to service this debt&mdash;especially as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates aggressively starting in 2020.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to internal financial disclosures, Del Monte&rsquo;s annual interest payments have nearly quadrupled in just five years. This massive jump has strained the company\'s cash flow, limiting its ability to innovate, invest in product development, or adapt to changing consumer preferences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CEO Longstreet emphasized that with a cleaner balance sheet and new ownership, the company will be better positioned for long-term growth. &ldquo;With an improved capital structure and enhanced financial position, we aim to build a more resilient and agile business,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Legacy Brand at a Crossroads</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Founded in 1886, Del Monte Foods is deeply embedded in American food history. The company opened its famed San Francisco cannery in 1907 and claimed by 1909 to run the world&rsquo;s largest fruit and vegetable canning operation. Products like canned peaches, green beans, and fruit cocktails have made their way into millions of households across the U.S.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Now, the Del Monte bankruptcy puts that legacy in jeopardy. Industry observers believe that the brand could either reemerge under new, more agile ownership or face a potential breakup and sale of assets to competitors or private equity firms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Consumers Unlikely to See Immediate Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the bankruptcy filing, Del Monte has reassured both retailers and customers that there will be no disruptions in product availability in the near term. Stores will continue to receive shipments, and consumers can still expect to see their favorite Del Monte products on grocery shelves.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">However, changes may be on the horizon. The Del Monte bankruptcy process could eventually lead to product line simplifications, pricing adjustments, or even shifts in branding strategy as the new owners focus on efficiency and profitability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Del Monte bankruptcy serves as a wake-up call for legacy <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/mcdonalds-to-drop-krispy-kreme-doughnuts-final-day-july22025\">food brands</a></span> struggling to adapt to today&rsquo;s economic and consumer landscape. While the company is not disappearing overnight, it faces a tough road ahead. With strong interim financing and a bold restructuring plan, there&rsquo;s a real possibility that Del Monte will survive this chapter and emerge leaner, more focused, and better prepared for the future of food retail.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-04', '22:53:11', 'del-monte-bankruptcy-iconic-u-s--food-brand-files-for-chapter-11', 'article/visionaries-network-delmont-bankruptcy.webp', 'visionaries network Del Monte Bankruptcy', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-delmont-bankruptcy.webp', 7, 2025, 'Delâ€¯Monte bankruptcy, visionaries network, Delâ€¯Monte Foods, canned goods industry, courtâ€‘supervised sale, food industry restructuring, Delâ€¯Monte debt, consumer preferences', 'Delâ€¯Monte Foods, the nearly 140â€‘yearâ€‘old cannedâ€‘goods company, has filed for Chapterâ€¯11 bankruptcy on Julyâ€¯1,â€¯2025.

Jurassic World: Rebirth is stomping into theaters with a new cast, a new thrilling location, and the same ancient danger fans adore. This sequel-reboot mashup stars Scarlett Johansson as Zora Bennett, commanding a high-risk expedition to a clandestine island complex on Ile Saint-Hubert&mdash;a shadowy spin-off of the original Jurassic Park.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Though the film offers action at the edge of your seat and a new franchise path that is popular, there is one question on everyone\'s lips once the credits roll: Is there a Jurassic World Rebirth post credit scene?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Does Jurassic World: Rebirth Have a Post-Credits Scene?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let\'s have it out&mdash;the short answer is no. There is no <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World\">Jurassic World</a></span> Rebirth post credit scene. Contrary to most modern blockbusters that lay groundwork for sequels or spin-offs following the end of the main film, this film finishes its story with the final frame before fading into the usual credit crawl.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">There is no surprise twist, no hidden recurring character at the end, and no mid-credits stage setting for the future. When the lights go down on the screen, the trip is over.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Of course, you\'re always welcome to stay seated to appreciate the work of the cast and crew&mdash;especially in a production of this magnitude. But for the rest of you rushing to the bathroom or racing to get out of the parking lot before traffic, you can leave in good conscience knowing there\'s nothing hiding behind the credits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Is Jurassic World: Rebirth About? </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Jurassic World: Rebirth, the franchise turns in a more suspenseful, spy-mission direction. Scarlett Johansson\'s Zora Bennett leads a specialized team in extracting valuable dinosaur DNA from an isolated island research facility that was originally used to study the original Jurassic Park.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The mission of the crew is noble&mdash;to acquire genetic material that holds the key to medical miracles. But the further they descend into the abandoned outpost, the darker the secrets they find.

The <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/28-years-later-movie-release-sparks-new-horror-frenzy\">movie</a></span> blends espionage, survival, and traditional dinosaur fright with a contemporary cinematic style. Critics are already referring to it as the most provocative installment since the original in 1993.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nevertheless, without any Jurassic World Rebirth post-credits tag, the movie doesn\'t stake a claim to a sequel&mdash;at least, not in the conventional Marvel-style format. Perhaps that\'s intentional, so the studio gets to dip its toes in the water before taking the plunge into the next one. It also teases the fans: Is this some kind of soft reboot, a standalone adventure, or the beginning of some epic prehistoric universe?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Fan Reactions to Missing Post-Credit Scene</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some are surprised online that there is no Jurassic World Rebirth post-credit scene&mdash;particularly in reaction to the trend of teasing continuity between movies. Others are applauding the move, terming it a \"refreshing return to the classic movie storytelling\" that respects the self-contained quality of a finished story.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;I was waiting for a stinger at the credits,\" quoted one Reddit commenter, \"but I like the restraint.

The TikTok US app relaunch is a strategic step by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to safeguard its access to the lucrative American market as it enters a more complex regulatory landscape.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Trump Confirms Ongoing Talks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Former President <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/is-easy-travel-still-possible-for-foreign-tourists-in-president-donald-trumps-america\">Donald Trump</a></span> provided the story additional momentum last Friday when he said he was going to start negotiating with Chinese officials \"Monday or Tuesday\" on a possible TikTok deal. He claimed that the United States \"pretty much\" had a deal to sell TikTok\'s U.S. operation in hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any final agreement, however, would require the approval of both the U.S. and Chinese governments. A previously suggested plan to spin off TikTok\'s U.S. operations into a new entity in which American investors would hold a majority stake was also deferred after China responded negatively to Trump\'s threat to impose higher tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the TikTok US app relaunch ahead of schedule in early September, ByteDance now appears to be being cautious in complying with any forthcoming court ruling&mdash;without removing the app from US users.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Gradual User Transition</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">TikTok has already finished rolling out its proposal, The Information reports. Once the new app goes live in app stores on September 5, users will be prompted to switch. The old platform will remain functional for a few months, but the transition to the new platform will be mandatory by March 2026&mdash;unless regulatory timelines shift again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The redeployment of the TikTok US app will be as disruption-less as possible, especially for influencers and creators who rely on the app for their livelihood. It is also intended to be a message to U.S. lawmakers and regulators that TikTok is serious about addressing issues regarding national security, specifically the gathering and storage of user data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Market and Industry Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The TikTok US app relaunch has an impact that can reach beyond TikTok\'s 150 million U.S. users to the tech industry at large. The platform, with over 150 million domestic users, is a giant in short-form video content. Its shift and relaunch under pressure may set a precedent for other global tech companies facing similar pressure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the current tensions between the U.S. and China, the new version of the application may incorporate modifications in data conduct, content filtering, or even the algorithm of the platform&mdash;all customized as per American regulatory needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Forward </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the September 17 deadline approaching for ByteDance to offload its US business, the coming weeks will be instructive. If a transaction gets done, it could make the TikTok US app relaunch worth more than just a stopgap measure&mdash;possibly the beginning of a sustained structural change in the way that global technology companies do business in the US.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While all this goes on behind the scenes, American users can expect further reminders and prods from TikTok to leap to the new app when it goes online. Meanwhile, the world will get to watch this digital and diplomatic soap opera unfold.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-08', '00:17:30', 'tiktok-us-app-relaunch-set-for-september-amid-ownership-shake-up', 'article/visionaries-network-tiktok-app-relaunch-us1.webp', 'TikTok US App Relaunch Set for September Amid Ownership Shake-Up', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-tiktok-app-relaunch-us1.webp', 7, 2025, 'TikTok US relaunch, TikTok ownership shake-up, TikTok September 2025, TikTok app relaunch, US TikTok updates, visionaries network, TikTok regulatory news', 'TikTok is set to relaunch its US app in September 2025 following major ownership changes.

The technology giant has just rolled out its 1 millionth robot, a milestone in its international business and a statement of its commitment to continuing to expand what it calls Amazon collaborative robots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The vision of the company, as cited by the company&rsquo;s <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyebrady/\">Chief Technologist Tye Brady</a></span>, is firmly based on the vision that machines can work with humans. \"It\'s not people versus machines,\" Brady said, \"it\'s people and machines working together.\" He explained that Amazon is leading the development of physical AI systems that will make society better, and that collaborative robotics is at the forefront of this revolution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From One Robot to a Million</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When Amazon initially began rolling out robotics back in 2012, its initial robots were tasked with moving inventory shelves across warehouse floors. Bring the clock forward to today, and the company now manages a large, highly specialized fleet of robots distributed across over 300 buildings worldwide. Each robot is coded to perform a single specific task to enable efficiency, accuracy, and safety within fulfillment operations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Some of the best-known members of this robotic army are:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Hercules, capable of lifting and transporting a maximum weight of 1,250 pounds</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Pegasus, with conveyor belts to separate individual packages</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Proteus, an autonomous robot able to travel freely amongst human workers</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These units are more than mere automatons&mdash;they are the embodiment of Amazon\'s ideal of a future where technology is used to contribute to human potential.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>DeepFleet: Robotics and AI</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of Amazon\'s recent breakthroughs is DeepFleet, an extremely powerful generative AI tool that can manage the navigation of its robot fleet. It is akin to a smart traffic controller for robots &mdash; optimizing routes, reducing traffic jams, and accelerating delivery by 10%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Similar to metropolitan city traffic systems that remove delays for motorists, DeepFleet allows Amazon\'s robots to move smoothly through warehouses. The technology is one aspect of Amazon\'s broader transition toward more intelligent, more secure logistics with humans always in charge.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brady emphasized that Amazon collaborative robots are not for cut-price automation. Instead, they\'re devices to enhance human capability. \"How do we make people want to use machines?\" he asked. \"How do we make the workplace better, safer, more productive, and allow workers to get their work done more effectively?\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Humans + Machines = Better Together</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At a recent \"Delivering the Future\" conference in Tokyo, Amazon rolled out its latest inventions and robotics plans. Brady promised that collaborative robotics is not in the future but now. \"We\'re creating machines that augment human capabilities,\" he explained. \"The ultimate goal is to put humans at the center of the robotics universe.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This philosophy is reflected in the Amazon collaborative robots approach. Rather than substituting for workers, these systems decrease physical labor, improve safety, and allow human employees to focus on larger or more inventive tasks.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">DeepFleet introduction also enhances Amazon collaborative robots\' decision-making. With AI monitoring the movement of traffic within warehouses and fulfillment centers, robots will be able to perform better in tandem with human teams to get customers faster and more reliably.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Overcoming the Automation Anxiety</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In spite of the hope that robotics would bring, there was still international fear that human jobs would be replaced by machines and AI. Brady met this challenge head-on by stating change is uncomfortable, but technology development doesn\'t have to be at the expense of human employment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"I\'ve spent years working on robotics,\" he said. \"It\'s taken decades to get machines to be really useful and safe in complicated environments. Now, they\'re getting people to work more efficiently. That\'s a good thing.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Brady takes Amazon collaborative robots as proof that AI can augment human ability and not replace it. As technology improves, the major challenge is not to replace people but to develop products they can work with effortlessly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Future Focused on Cooperation </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Amazon\'s robotics investment doesn\'t seem to be letting up. With DeepFleet now on board and more than a million robots at work, the company is blazing the trail with its vision for collaborative robotics&mdash;a world in which machines are collaborators, not replacements.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Since more companies are looking toward automation to deal with labor and efficiency concerns, Amazon collaborative robots could be leading the way for the rest of the industry. In the name of safety, efficiency, and coexistence with humans, Amazon is demonstrating to the world that the future of robots can be high-tech and highly human.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-08', '00:24:23', 'amazon-collaborative-robots-aim-to-boost-human-potential', 'article/visionaries-network-amazon-collaborative-robot.jpg', 'Amazon Collaborative Robots Aim to Boost Human Potential', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-amazon-collaborative-robot.jpg', 7, 2025, 'Amazon collaborative robots, Amazon warehouse automation, human-robot collaboration, visionaries network, Amazon logistics tech, boosting human potential, warehouse robotics', 'Amazon is deploying collaborative robots&mdash;or &ldquo;cobots&rdquo;&mdash;to work alongside human employees in its fulfillment centers.

SpaceX Starlink 10-28 will launch at 4:21 a.m. from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending 28 additional satellites to the company\'s expanding constellation in low-Earth orbit.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This mission is an extension of SpaceX\'s busy pace in 2025 and is similar to the bigger Starlink mission with the aim of providing high-speed satellite internet connectivity to the whole world. This launch puts the company further at the forefront of global space connectivity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Not Pad 39A This Time</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Initially, the Federal Aviation Administration advisory suggested that the launch would be from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center of <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/\">NASA</a></span>. The rocket will actually be launching from LC-40, part of a recent pattern of change of launch sites by SpaceX. The changes, though often made on the night before liftoff, have not deterred the company\'s strong launch rate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cape Canaveral already had 58 launches this year in 2025, and today is the 59th Florida Space Coast launch of 2025. The Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station location continues to be the hub of commercial and governmental space activities in the US.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Weather: Somewhat Unstable but Manageable</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The National Weather Service late Monday evening to Tuesday night forecast indicates a 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms, primarily before 2 a.m. Forecast temperatures will dip to around 75&deg;F, with southeast winds at 5 to 10 mph. Even with the chance of some incidental weather interference, overall conditions remain favorable for liftoff.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SpaceX is familiar with launching with tight weather windows, and short of a last-minute change in the weather, the SpaceX Starlink 10-28 launch should proceed on time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Payload: More Broadband from Orbit </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Falcon 9 rocket is launching 28 Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit on a northeasterly trajectory. The satellites, once deployed, will be just a few of thousands already forming a web of orbital internet infrastructure. The growing Starlink constellation is especially welcome in rural and remote communities where traditional broadband services are not available or are limited.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As has become commonplace practice, the first-stage booster of the Falcon 9 will make its way back to an Atlantic Ocean drone ship, where it will be reused on later missions. Recovery and refurbishment of the booster is a key component of SpaceX\'s business model, conserving money and enabling it to launch more frequently.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead: Beyond Military Missions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Aside from the SpaceX Starlink 10-28 launch, the company continues to win enormous government contracts.

The post raised a glass to Breakthrough T1D\'s work and emphasized how toy representation has the power to spark hard conversations in homes and in schools.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thousands of users flocked to respond with enthusiasm, with most responding with a story of their own. One wrote, \"I\'m diabetic and so hyped for this doll. She\'s going on my wishlist.\" Another, diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a kid, wrote, \"This is what I waited my whole life for&mdash;understanding and representation.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One very poignant one said, \"When I was diagnosed at 6, THIS would have meant everything to me. There was no Type 1 diabetes doll when I was growing up. Kids thought I was contagious.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>High-Profile Supporters Join the Movement </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In support of the launch, Barbie teamed with two prominent Type 1 diabetes champions, such as <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14885067/Lila-Moss-fronts-new-campaign-Barbie-launches-diabetic-doll-model-opened-living-condition.html\">model Lila Moss</a></span> and Peloton teacher Robin Arz&oacute;n. Both have publicly shared their own personal experiences of living with the condition and are helping to drive awareness and acceptance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Their participation puts not only the doll, but the larger debate surrounding lifelong illness in children, at center stage. By joining forces with public leaders, Barbie assures that health difficulties do not constrain ability, attractiveness, or achievement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Era of Empowering Toys</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The launch of the Type 1 diabetes doll is more than a marketing campaign&mdash;it is a social movement. By creating a doll that embodies the life of millions of kids across the globe, Barbie is showing the world that disease need not be stigmatized or feared&mdash;it can be learned, revered, and even celebrated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The move by Mattel to add such representation to one of the most recognized toy lines of all time is being embraced with open arms by families and medical professionals alike. It\'s a powerful message to children with diabetes: You are not alone, and your story matters. Wherever it may live, on a playroom shelf or a Capitol Hill conference table, this doll is already making an impact.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-10', '01:18:19', 'barbies-new-type-1-diabetes-doll-wins-hearts-online', 'article/visionaries-netwok-barbie-diabetic.webp', 'Barbie&rsquo;s New Type 1 Diabetes Doll Wins Hearts Online', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-netwok-barbie-diabetic.webp', 7, 2025, 'Barbie diabetes doll, Type 1 diabetes awareness, inclusive dolls, diabetic Barbie, visionaries network, diabetes education for kids', 'Barbie&rsquo;s new Type 1 Diabetes doll is receiving widespread praise for promoting inclusivity and raising awareness about the condition.

The Indian-American industry veteran\'s hiring is a milestone not only for Apple but for global representation of leadership in the technology industry. Having worked nearly three decades at Apple, Khan has a deep understanding of the company\'s operations, supply base, and sustainability programs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Currently Apple\'s Vice President of Operations, Khan\'s promotion to COO demonstrates his key role in establishing Apple supply chain, manufacturing operations, and ethical supply policies. Therefore, his promotion has been welcomed by Apple CEO Tim Cook, who described him as \"a brilliant strategist and one of the central architects of Apple\'s supply chain.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Sabih arrives with heart and values, and I have no doubt he will be a great chief operating officer,\" Cook said. \"He was instrumental in ensuring Apple can be responsive to the world\'s challenges.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sabih Khan Apple COO announcement also depicts Apple\'s commitment to sustainable growth and operational excellence in an increasingly competitive and dynamic business landscape.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From Moradabad to Apple\'s Executive Suite</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sabih Khan was born in 1966 in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. He moved to Singapore at the age of 10. He subsequently moved to the United States and obtained a double bachelor\'s degree in economics and mechanical engineering from Tufts University. He also obtained a master\'s degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Before he joined Apple in 1995, Khan worked at GE Plastics (now SABIC), where he was a key account technical leader and application development leader. Khan\'s engineering and materials background was well-positioned to handle the demanding task of developing and operating global operations for Apple.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Khan has also played a significant role in defining Apple\'s operations and supply chain over the past 30 years. In 2019, he became Senior Vice President of operations, overseeing procurement, planning, manufacturing, logistics, product quality, and fulfillment. He has also overseen Apple\'s supplier responsibility programs that emphasize fair labor practices, education of workers, and sustainability.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Driving Innovation and Sustainability</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of Khan\'s greatest contributions has been his sustainability leadership. Apple, under his guidance, has partnered with eco-friendly suppliers and made tremendous efforts in becoming less environmentally friendly. Apple attributes him with enabling the company to reduce its carbon footprint by over 60 percent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tim Cook previously spoke of Khan\'s ability to introduce \"new technologies and advanced approaches\" that improved Apple\'s supply chain while also expanding its manufacturing presence in the United States.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sabih Khan Apple COO will oversee operations at a time when global technology giants are facing increasing pressure to innovate responsibly and uphold production standards.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Williams to Retire; Khan to Shoulder Great Responsibilities</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Exiting COO Jeff Williams will remain at Apple until he retires later this year, managing the <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/apple-watch-upgrade-set-to-transform-wearables-by-2027\">Apple Watch</a></span> and design teams.

The Silicon Valley chipmaker, now the world\'s most valuable company, reached a new all-time high stock price of $164.42 this Wednesday morning, yet another milestone on its meteoric ascent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Record-Breaking Milestone</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nvidia $4 trillion valuation capitalization positions it above some of the tech industry\'s best-known brands. Microsoft is second at the $3.7 trillion market capitalization, followed by Apple at $3.1 trillion, Amazon at $2.4 trillion, and Alphabet, Google\'s parent, at $2.2 trillion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To put this achievement into context, Nvidia\'s worth is now greater than the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the entire United Kingdom of $3.9 trillion for the last year. This staggering comparison puts into context the disproportionate impact of AI technology and Nvidia\'s central function in driving it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From Denny\'s Diner to World Domination</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nvidia\'s origins date back to 1993, when co-founders Chris Malachowsky, Jensen Huang, and Curtis Priem talked about the company over the counter of a Denny\'s restaurant booth. Three decades on, that simple idea had grown into the world\'s largest AI chipmaker, spearheading the generative AI revolution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its core offerings&mdash;graphics processing units (GPUs)&mdash;are the foundation hardware upon which to train and run advanced AI models. These GPUs are the foundation of high-profile AI applications like OpenAI\'s ChatGPT, Elon Musk\'s xAI, Tesla\'s self-driving cars, Meta\'s AI initiatives, and Amazon\'s cloud computing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A $10 Investment That Changed Lives</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a decade, the price of Nvidia stock has risen by nearly 35,000%, which means a July 2015 investment of $1,000 in Nvidia would be worth an astounding $350,000 today. This is in contrast to the S&amp;P 500\'s 260% increase over the same ten-year period (including dividends), which ranks Nvidia as one of the better-performing stocks of the past decade.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The success is credited by analysts to Nvidia\'s sheer commitment to AI and dominance of a commanding percentage of the hardware stack required for generative AI applications. While tech giants scramble to develop faster and intelligent AI models, Nvidia has emerged as the supplier of choice for high-performance computing infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Nvidia\'s Role in the AI Gold Rush</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Nvidia $4 trillion valuation is a direct consequence of the boom in generative AI services beginning with the public launch of ChatGPT and similar tools. As every company is trying to develop their own AI-powered services and platforms, Nvidia\'s GPUs are the back end of such initiatives.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Wall Street\'s faith in Nvidia has only grown stronger as the company keeps beating earnings estimates and winning multiyear deals with the industry\'s biggest players. In addition, demand for AI data centers and supercomputing capacity continues to rise at a rapidly accelerating rate, setting Nvidia up to keep growing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What\'s Next for Nvidia</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even after achieving this feat, Nvidia does not give any indication of taking its foot off the gas. Its CEO, Jensen Huang, has said that the company\'s aspirations go beyond chips&mdash;into end-to-end AI computing solutions, such as software platforms and cloud services devoted to AI.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With this level of dominant market share and first-mover status in the AI market, analysts feel that Nvidia can surpass estimates and even shoot for an even higher valuation in the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Nvidia $4 trillion valuation is not only a milestone in finance&mdash;it\'s a sign of artificial intelligence\'s importance to our contemporary economy. From a midnight idea at a Denny\'s to its status as the world\'s most valuable company, Nvidia\'s narrative is one of vision, creativity, and fantastic timing.

Speaking in an interview with CNBC on Monday, Navarro again stated that Apple\'s rate of shifting production out of China remains \"unacceptable,\" despite rising political pressure emanating from Washington.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Apple and the China Supply Chain Controversy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The remarks have again placed the long-standing controversy surrounding <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/apple-watch-upgrade-set-to-transform-wearables-by-2027\">Apple</a></span> China\'s supply chain in the spotlight, a situation that is fast becoming more and more complex amidst changing geopolitics and economic realignments. While the Biden administration has assumed the Trump administration\'s policy of pushing American companies to diversify away from Chinese production, analysts observe that for Apple, the transition is not only costly&mdash;it is potentially short-term impossible.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to CNBC, analysts and supply chain professionals estimate that it would take up to $3,500 to produce an iPhone completely in the U.S. That whopping increase&mdash;more than triple what it now costs&mdash;is one of the key reasons that Apple is so competitive in the global smartphone space, where speed-to-market and price are paramount.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Apple is so deeply entrenched in China</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the midst of political turmoil, Apple has provided little sign that it would leave China\'s supply chain. Apple has built long-term relationships in the country for reasons other than pure cost savings. China offers a complete, integrated system for high-end manufacturing that few countries can provide.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Apple China supply chain provides unmatched efficiency, reliability, and innovation. From super-accurate tooling to next-generation automation and materials engineering, manufacturing innovation in China is key to Apple\'s ability to ship high-quality products at scale.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During a visit to Chinese factories in March, Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams praised China\'s success in smart manufacturing. News outlets quoted Williams saying that decades of infrastructure development and manufacturing upgrading have transformed China into a world leader in high-tech manufacturing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Innovation Ecosystem and Highly Qualified Labor</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the other enormous benefits of the Apple China supply chain is access to a huge talent pool of skilled workers. China\'s industrial labor force has thousands of engineers, technicians, and high-level tooling experts. Apple CEO Tim Cook has often mentioned the country\'s unparalleled concentration of talent as an underlying factor that the company still makes and manufactures so many of its products there.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Apart from its production facilities, Apple has set up various R&amp;D centers in China, attracting high-quality graduates from prestigious universities. These centers are hotbeds of innovation, serving to support Apple\'s product innovation and supply chain enhancement.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This overlap between production, R&amp;D, and logistics allows Apple to bring new products to market more cheaply and rapidly&mdash;advantages that are critical in the hyper-competitive technology world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The China Market Advantage</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition to production, China is also among Apple\'s largest and fastest-growing consumer markets. With a vast and technology-savvy middle class, it has strong demand for high-end electronics like the iPhone and MacBook.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Moreover, China\'s fast-growing digital ecosystem&mdash;with leading mobile payment platforms, seamless e-commerce platforms, and innovative user interaction models&mdash;is fertile soil for Apple to develop its digital services and ecosystem business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Policy and Business Implications</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While US officials such as Navarro remain adamant about nearshoring or reshoring US technology manufacturing, matters are more complicated. The Apple China supply chain cannot be so simply unwound. It might result in production costs exploding, product launch timing being slowed, and diminished global competitiveness for one of America\'s most prized assets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Apple, as with most multinational companies, has to reconcile economic sense with geopolitical reality. At least in the short term, China\'s infrastructure, human resources, market size, and innovation potential make it continue to be an integral part of Apple\'s global strategy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ultimate Reflections </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The battle for Apple\'s supply chain is symptomatic of a greater conflict between national strategic interests and economic globalization. No matter how vigorously Washington brings the pressure, companies like Apple will be reluctant to go gently.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Apple China supply chain is one of the pillars of the company\'s success&mdash;something that will not be readily replaced without accompanying tradeoffs.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-12', '00:51:30', 'apple-china-supply-chain-faces-heat-from-white-house', 'article/visionareis-network-apple-china-supply-chain.webp', 'Apple China Supply Chain Faces Heat from White House', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionareis-network-apple-china-supply-chain.webp', 7, 2025, 'Apple supply chain, visionaries network, White House Apple policy, U.S.-China relations, Apple manufacturing China, geopolitical impact on Apple', 'Apple faces increased pressure from the White House over its reliance on China-based suppliers.

The surprise album features 20 tracks and is released at a time when the singer\'s personal life and mental well-being have been the focus of renewed scrutiny.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Justin Bieber new album Swag contains songs such as Dadz Love, Therapy Session, and Devotion, which are a deeper and more introspective aspect of the artist. The album, which lasts a bit under an hour, includes collaborations with some of the largest names in rap, including Gunna, Cash Cobain, and Sexxy Red.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bieber\'s comeback follows a four-year break since his previous attempt, Justice, in 2021. Swag follows social media gossip about Bieber\'s recent altercation with paparazzi and his apparent annoyance at being relentlessly pursued by the media. A viral video clip &mdash; where he tells one photographer, \"I\'m a dad. I\'m a husband. You\'re not getting it. It\'s not clocking to you. I\'m standing on business.\" &mdash; has now been creatively sampled in one of the album tracks, Butterflies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Emotional and Spiritual Implications in Swag</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Justin Bieber new album Swag is not just a pop phenomenon; it is also loaded with a heavy dose of emotional depth. Tracks such as Daisies seem to offer an unrestrained glimpse into his relationship with wife Hailey Bieber, with lyrics such as \"falling petals, do you love me or not?\" and \"you said forever, babe, did you mean it or not?\" that are both vulnerable and introspective.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The personal Christian beliefs of Bieber are also reflected in songs such as Devotion, Forgiveness, and Soulful. These are all about redemption, spiritual growth, and responsibility -- an extension of the religious concepts that have driven a lot of his recent output.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Promotional images shared by Bieber feature his wife and the couple\'s baby in golden-hued, retro-style portraits &mdash; one of which features Hailey holding their baby as Bieber turns his back to the camera in front of a sweeping vista of rolling hills. The word \"SWAG\" is big and in capital letters with the family, reflecting the visual aesthetic of the album.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Fans and Celebrities Respond to Swag</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Justin Bieber\'s new Swag album has already created a lot of commotion on the internet. <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2024/06/warning-labels-on-social-media\">Social media</a></span> was abuzz when the album went online, with fans praising the singer\'s maturity and authenticity. \"YES!!!!\" US rapper Big Sean commented on Bieber\'s Instagram release of the album. The majority of fans also commented on how the emotional words and spiritual feel resonated with them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Swag title appears to be a reference to Bieber\'s 2012 period, including his top single Boyfriend, which had \"swag, swag, swag on you.\" That throwback reference could be Bieber\'s attempt at courting his past fans while also familiarizing them with a grown-up, matured Bieber.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bieber\'s musical artistry triumphs despite some public criticism and controversies. Justin Bieber new album Swag is an unmistakable evolution &mdash; a blend of hip-hop, gospel rhythms, and thought-provoking lyrics &mdash; and it testifies that he has a lot more to say, and a new story to tell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Return Based on Self-Expression</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Justin Bieber new album Swag is not just an album drop, it\'s a proclamation. From dealing with media intrusion to fighting emotional demons and embracing family life, Bieber\'s new album is layered and full of tales.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Fans looking to untangle the spiritual and emotional meaning in each song will be rewarded by Swag. Bieber positions himself not merely as a pop sensation, but as a grown-up artist willing to experiment and stretch to his fans with this album.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether you\'re a Belieber from day one or a new Belieber, Justin Bieber\'s new song Swag is worth a listen &mdash; and could be his most sincere effort to date.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br style=\"mso-special-character: line-break;\"><!--[endif]--></p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-12', '01:09:30', 'justin-bieber-new-album-swag-sparks-surprise-and-excitement', 'article/visionaries-newtork-justin-bieber-swag-new-album.webp', 'Justin Bieber New Album &lsquo;Swag&rsquo; Sparks Surprise and Excitement', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-newtork-justin-bieber-swag-new-album.webp', 7, 2025, 'Justin Bieber Swag album, new Justin Bieber album, Justin Bieber 2025, Swag album release, visionaries network, Justin Bieber fan reactions', 'Justin Bieber shocks fans with the unexpected release of his new album &lsquo;Swag.&rsquo; Discover the reactions, track highlights, and what this means for his music comeback.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

The break above the trendline is a bullish technical signal and can mark the start of a new trend upwards.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Supporting this view, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below overbought ground, which means Bitcoin still has further to travel. With momentum on its side and without any meaningful resistance above, Bitcoin can now be said to be going into what traders call \"price discovery mode.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While Coinbase volumes are below projections, most believe this to be the case of institutional acquisition via spot Bitcoin ETFs, so not retail acquisition on crypto exchanges. These stealth accumulations are perhaps a building block for future growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Technical Target Hints at $146,400</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to the technical analysis measurement principle, the subsequent target for Bitcoin\'s price increase may be up to $146,400. This is obtained by adding the distance of the previous trend before the downtrend channel to the point of breakout.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Here\'s the math: The next uptrend added $37,600 of price action. Multiply that by the breakout point of around $108,800 and we arrive at the estimated target of $146,400. If this estimate is accurate, Bitcoin can potentially rise another 32% from here.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This bullish setup, coupled with mounting institutional participation, is propelling investor sentiment firmly now that Bitcoin hits new record high again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Critical Support Levels for Bitcoin</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As bulls are also riding the recent milestone, traders also need to monitor major support levels in case of any retracements. The initial support level to monitor is $107,000, just below the breakout point level and along the 50-day moving average. This is also where former resistance levels during December and January now may provide support.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If $107,000 fails to support, the next significant level is at $100,000. The psychologically significant level completes the lower edge of the prior declining channel and intersects late 2024 trading action. Buyers will try to get back in here if Bitcoin is exposed to a wider market pullback.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Bitcoin hits new record high as Crypto Mood Improves</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bitcoin hits new record high while at the same time the overall sentiment in the crypto markets is becoming increasingly positive. A number of U.S. politicians are busy introducing more transparent regulations so there are fewer barriers for institutions and retail traders to become a part of the digital asset market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In addition, more and more companies are now beginning to invest some of their firm cash balances in Bitcoin, viewing it as an inflation hedge and an economic uncertainty hedge. Such trends are driving adoption and demand for Bitcoin at a period when supply is capped at 21 million coins.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Long-Term Prospects Remain Positive</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While short-term retracements are a certainty in any bull market, the bigger picture is strongly bullish. With strong support in place and institutions strongly in favor of the asset, most experts believe that Bitcoin is well set for sustained gains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Bitcoin hits new record high for fifth time in a year, momentum is very much in bulls\' favor. If price is above breakdown levels and volume is on the rise, next leg higher towards $146,000 can be sooner than later.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bitcoin hits new record high&mdash;a phrase becoming more popular in 2025. Bitcoin is proving once more why it remains the power to be reckoned with in the crypto world, thanks to solid technicals, institutional demand, and increasing regulatory clarity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Investors need to remain closely focused on key levels and remain on their toes as the market moves into a potentially explosive new phase.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-12', '01:18:06', 'bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-as-price-surges', 'article/visionaries-network-bitcoin-hits-new-record.webp', 'Bitcoin Hits New Record High as Price Surges Past $112,000', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-bitcoin-hits-new-record.webp', 7, 2025, 'Bitcoin record high, Bitcoin $116K, cryptocurrency surge, institutional investment, crypto regulation, Bitcoin price Julyâ€¯2025', 'Bitcoin breaks new all-time highs, eclipsing $116K on strong institutional investment and proâ€‘crypto U.S. policies.

The stunning rise has redirected the debate around the most recent XRP price prediction, and investors and experts are competing to put their money on the token\'s future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rise is fueled by a combination of macro market sentiment and critical regulatory news that will determine the future of XRP for the rest of 2025 and beyond.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ripple CEO\'s Senate Testimony Spreads Confidence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the heart of XRP\'s recent rally is Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse\'s testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. His testimony was a turning point in the debate surrounding crypto regulation. Garlinghouse emphatically argued the case for clear, predictable policy that would enable innovation while protecting investors &mdash; a case which appears to have found traction with lawmakers and the market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For anyone following any XRP price prediction, this is big news. Clear regulation has been XRP\'s missing piece of the puzzle in its drive to be an institution-friendly digital currency. According to analysts, if Ripple\'s lobbying efforts in Washington succeed, the way would be paved for <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/jamie-dimons-outlook-vs-jpmorgans-soaring-profits\">financial institutions\'</a></span> wholesale adoption.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Bitcoin\'s New All-Time High Pumps Up Altcoins</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But another key catalyst for the XRP rally is the recent record-breaking Bitcoin rally, which boosted sentiment in the wider <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/crypto-etfs-approved-wall-streets-biggest-bet-on-blockchain-stocks-yet\">crypto</a></span> universe. Bitcoin\'s historical bull cycles have fueled the trend for the altcoins, and that was also the case this week.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For XRP, then, the success of Bitcoin is a vote of confidence. It validates generalized optimism within the market and gives further impetus for traders to stay bullish. With this in mind, any short-term XRP price prediction must be corrected for the influence of <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/07/bitcoin-hits-new-record-high-as-price-surges\">Bitcoin</a></span>, for it still sets crypto-wide trends.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>XRP Price Forecast in 2025: $3, $5, or More?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With XRP nearing its earlier all-time high, the next question arises: How much can XRP increase in 2025? While opinions are divided, some positive analysts predict XRP to break the $3 mark and even reach $5 or even higher, assuming regulatory clarity and further institutional partnerships.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These forecasts rely on several assumptions: that Ripple will have positive legal outcomes, that banks will begin to add XRP to cross-border payment systems, and that the balance of the crypto market is healthy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But the bear camp is not convinced. As recently laid out in Motley Fool analysis, XRP yet has to be shown to be of any use compared to newer, faster, and more scalable blockchain initiatives. Naysayers believe the price is overbought, with more hype than reality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What Drives a Right XRP Price Prediction?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As with any of the cryptos, any XRP price prediction must be based on some sort of technical, fundamental, and macroeconomic factors. The following are the most salient factors most likely to determine the future of XRP:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Regulatory Clarity:</strong> U.S. legislation and court and regulatory rulings can significantly impact the price of XRP &mdash; either positively or negatively.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Institutional Adoption:</strong> The wider the number of banks, remittance companies, and financial institutions Ripple can partner with, the more valuable XRP will be.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Bitcoin Price Fluctuations:</strong> A robust BTC tends to have favorable winds for XRP and other altcoins.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><strong>Investor Sentiment and Economic Conditions:</strong> Macro trends that span everything from interest rates to inflation and liquidity globally will persist.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Should You Place Bet on the New XRP Price Forecast?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The recent price surge offers hope and warning. The optimists have a tidy story: Ripple is discussing with policymakers, sentiment is positive in the markets, and XRP\'s current infrastructure is on the cusp of lift-off. But experienced investors know that crypto always has an ace up its sleeve.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Any XRP price forecast, however convincing, is always a shot in the dark &mdash; a prediction, not a certainty.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Last Words: Volatility Is the Name of the Game </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">XRP\'s recent rise on the charts shows the velocity at which fortunes can change in the crypto world. It also shows the volatility of this high-speed marketplace. Depending on Ripple\'s Washington strategy, investor sentiment, and what is happening in the world of global regulation, XRP has the potential to ride these gains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For the time being, XRP owners and future buyers alike have every incentive to remain interested &mdash; and vigilant. The second half of 2025 will be a defining time for the token, and XRP price prediction hype will only grow more raucous as we go along.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-15', '00:12:35', 'xrp-price-prediction-signals-bullish-trend-for-2025', 'article/visionaries-network-xrp-price-prediction-signals-bullish-trending.webp', 'visionaries network - XRP price prediction signals bullish trend for 2025', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-xrp-price-prediction-signals-bullish-trending.webp', 7, 2025, 'XRP, Ripple, XRP prediction, visionaries network, crypto forecast, bullish crypto, XRP price, XRP trends, Ripple 2025, crypto market, XRP news, crypto signals, Ripple price, XRP analysis, altcoin', 'XRP price prediction for 2025 shows a bullish trend, driven by market momentum, adoption, and investor confidence in Ripple&rsquo;s ecosystem.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

This dizzying ascent &mdash; from $108,000 a week or so ago &mdash; propels Bitcoin as the world\'s fifth-most valuable asset with a mind-boggling market value of $2.4 trillion, overtaking tech giant Amazon.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CoinMarketCap data indicate that this spike is part of a longer trend that started in late April, when Bitcoin recovered from a brief dip below $75,000. Institutional buying, positive regulation, and strong political backing have all played a part in Bitcoin\'s spectacular rise since then.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Congress readies for \'Crypto Week\'</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It is \"crypto week\" in the nation\'s capital this week, as lawmakers consider sweeping legislation that would transform the U.S. crypto market in fundamental ways. Already on its way to the House for consideration is a bill to regulate stablecoins. Lawmakers will also consider a more sweeping cryptocurrency market structure bill that would establish categorical regulations for digital assets and exchanges.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This legislative energy follows on the back of rising pressure from <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/07/tiktok-us-app-relaunch-set-for-september-amid-ownership-shake-up\">President Donald Trump</a></span> and the cryptocurrency industry. Trump, who was initially an open critic of cryptocurrencies, has mellowed and promised to make America the \"global capital of crypto\" in his second term. His administration is now actively advocating the use of crypto across the board &mdash; from mining and payment systems to the release of stablecoins.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Trump Family\'s Crypto Venture Spurs Speculation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adding to the mania, the Trump clan has bet big on the crypto world. From buying billions of dollars\' worth of Bitcoin to introducing a Trump-branded meme token, the former president and his entourage are making calculated forays through the digital asset realm. Trump\'s recent adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has given the asset class an extra dose of legitimacy &mdash; especially among conservative investors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Industry participants point out that Trump\'s new support will influence fence-sitting legislators, especially when the 2026 electoral cycle begins to take form. \"When a political giant like Trump gets on the Bitcoin bandwagon, that blows the whole script out,\" a Washington, D.C.-based crypto lobbyist said. \"It\'s no longer on the fringe; it\'s mainstream.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Fuel Institutional Demand</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The other main catalyst for the Bitcoin rally is the success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which debuted a year ago. The ETFs have made it possible for institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the technical hassles of self-custody or the crypto wallet. MicroStrategy and Tesla have continued to buy more Bitcoin using stock offerings and borrowing, doubling down on the wager that Bitcoin is a long-term store of value.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Bitcoin sets new all-time high as demand is outpacing supply,\" said Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. \"This represents institutional demand combining with Bitcoin\'s fundamentals, and a limited supply doing what it was designed to do.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Just 21 million bitcoins will ever be extracted, generating a scarcity-based dynamic that continually contrasts Bitcoin with gold. The argument is that this inherent scarcity makes Bitcoin the perfect inflation hedge and protection against profligate governments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Crypto Lobby\'s Washington Strategy Pays Off</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Behind the scenes, the crypto sector has become one of Washington\'s most powerful lobbies. Crypto firms intensified political spending in last year\'s midterm elections after years of being targeted by the Biden administration and are continuing to spend big on lobbying in 2025.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That strategy is paying off. Both camps now favor more lenient crypto regulations, and the market euphoria is stronger than ever. Bitcoin hits another all-time high as retail, hedge funds, and institutions all flood into the market, hoping this is the beginning of a new era of crypto-friendly policy in America.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Outlook: What\'s Next for Bitcoin?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With Congress considering historic crypto legislation and supporting Trump\'s crypto-friendly policies, investors are optimistic. Additional price gains are forecast by analysts in the coming weeks &mdash; especially if the legislation being considered in Congress passes both chambers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With supportive policies, increased institutional exposure through ETFs, and political support at the highest level, Bitcoin hits another all-time high and appears to go even higher in the not-so-distant future.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-15', '00:00:05', 'bitcoin-hits-another-all-time-high-at-123000', 'article/vsionaries-network-bitcoin-hits-another-all-time-high.webp', 'Bitcoin Hits Another All-Time High', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/vsionaries-network-bitcoin-hits-another-all-time-high.webp', 7, 2025, 'Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, BTC price, Bitcoin news, all-time high, crypto market, blockchain, trading, visionaries network, Bitcoin surge, digital currency, crypto prices, financial news, BTC rally, crypto update', 'Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high of $123,000, signaling strong investor confidence and renewed momentum in the crypto market.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

The fees, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars annually, are a paradigm shift from unfettered access these companies have enjoyed to date.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The largest bank in the United States, JPMorgan, has already begun to send detailed lists of prices to fintech app intermediaries such as Plaid Inc. and MX. The prices, according to reports, vary depending on how the data is used, with payment apps paying more.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Costly Adjustment for Fintech Startups</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The implications of JPMorgan bank data fees are significant for Venmo, Coinbase, and Robinhood, which conduct payments, make trades, and maintain digital purses based on up-to-the-minute customer information. Many of the services rely on account information provided by the aggregators, and the new fees may filter through &mdash; first to the fintechs, and then to the consumers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the sources who preferred anonymity charged that the suggested charges would be as much as 1000% above the income these companies experience per transaction. That would lead startups to reconsider their whole business models or find new ways to subsidize access to information.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"These types of suggested fees are not just operating costs,\" said one fintech executive, who declined to be named. \"They disrupt the economics on which many fintech products rely.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Open Banking Regulation at Center of Legal Conflict</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">JPMorgan\'s action comes as there is a question about the future of a Biden-era open banking rule that was adopted in October. The rule allows consumers to share their financial data openly with third-party service providers, fostering competition and innovation. Its supporters argue that it gives consumers more control over their financial identity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But the banking industry has moved firmly against the step, citing security threats. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has raised alarms on a regular basis regarding the dangers of unfettered access to sensitive financial data. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under Donald Trump\'s last administration filed an action to halt the rule, and a federal court may decide its fate later this year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Should the rule be removed or eased, JPMorgan bank data fees could become the norm &mdash; forcing fintechs to pay in order to receive what is currently free.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Security and Infrastructure Investments Cited</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">JPMorgan has justified the step, saying it has invested heavily in secure data-sharing channels that protect customers\' information. The spokesperson said, \"We\'ve had constructive conversation and are working with the entire ecosystem to ensure we\'re all making investments in the infrastructure we need to keep our customers safe.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The spokesman did not offer specific amounts but stressed that the charges were meant to represent the security and worth of the bank\'s data infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ongoing Negotiations with Aggregators</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While charges are not yet determined and are negotiable, negotiations between aggregator companies and JPMorgan are in progress. The negotiations are described by insiders as \"constructive,\" as some of the data providers are trying to reduce the financial load on smaller fintechs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But most analysts think that this is merely the tip of the iceberg. \"If other big banks see that JPMorgan is getting away with this, they will follow suit,\" replied Linda Grant, fintech analyst at MacroView Insights. \"It would set a precedent for profiteering off customers\' streams of information throughout the entire banking industry.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion: A Tipping Point for Fintech?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The impending imposition of JPMorgan bank data fees is a watershed moment in the relationship between traditional banks and fintech companies. While the final shape of these fees will depend on regulatory evolution and negotiation, this is certain: the era of free access to bank data is at an end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the fintechs reimagine their models, their customers may experience the shock waves &mdash; in the form of increased fees, reduced bells and whistles, or restricted access to new financial products.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-16', '00:14:56', 'jpmorgan-bank-data-fees-may-reshape-fintech-landscape', 'article/visionaries-network-jpmorganchase-fintech-bank-data-fees-may-reshape.webp', 'JPMorgan Bank Data Fees May Reshape Fintech Landscape', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-jpmorganchase-fintech-bank-data-fees-may-reshape.webp', 7, 2025, 'JPMorgan, data fees, fintech, banking, API charges, financial services, fintech integration, banking fees, visionaries network, developer fees, fintech disruption, digital banking, financial innovation, data pricing, corporate banking', 'JPMorgan&rsquo;s planned data fees could reshape the fintech landscape, altering API access, developer costs, and the dynamics of innovation in financial services.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

With over 140 currencies covered and over 100 licenses in jurisdictions globally, the company has emerged as one of the top infrastructure partners for businesses making international payments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In an interview with FinTech Magazine, CEO Gary Conroy discussed how TransferMate\'s regulatory-first approach, combined with its API-led architecture, provides frictionless and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/04/ebay-klarna-partnership-2025-brings-flexible-payments-to-the-us\">secure payment capability</a></span> to clients worldwide.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Multi-Jurisdictional Licensing Ensures Safety</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Being a cross-border payments provider, TransferMate\'s real strength is in its regulatory depth. With regulatory oversight by more than 100 regulators around the world, TransferMate has developed an infrastructure that has compliance, security, and transparency in its DNA.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"We have over a hundred regulators and they\'re reviewing everything we\'re doing to ensure that we\'re adhering to the robust processes that are in place,\" CEO Gary Conroy said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">TransferMate\'s regulatory strategy includes strong safeguarding measures that keep client money ring-fenced in separate accounts. This means that in the worst-case scenarios, customer funds are more secure from operational risk.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"That is a way of keeping customer funds segregated so that if something ever did occur to us, our customer funds would be safe,\" Conroy said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This multi-tiered system involves oversight not just from regulators but also from third-party auditors and banking counterparties. This integrated system ensures consistency and compliance in all avenues of operations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Building Embedded Payments with API-First Design</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the heart of TransferMate\'s success as a cross-border payments provider is its solid technical infrastructure. TransferMate was API-first in its development from an incredibly early stage, allowing businesses to integrate cross-border payments into their own platforms.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This API-centric architecture offers seamless integration for clients with cross-border payment needs. The platform can store 30 currencies of stored value, enabling businesses to receive and store funds locally and do business internationally.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As Conroy describes it, \"We\'ve begun from the beginning with APIs supporting embedded payments, and we\'ve layered on top of that stored value accounts so customers can issue accounts denominated in local currency in other jurisdictions.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Innovative Business Tools for Flexibility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">TransferMate keeps adapting to fulfil emerging user requirements. Its new features enable customers to receive same-currency cross-border wire transfers in cash and lock in competitive exchange rates before payment. These features are crucial for companies that trade in fluctuating FX markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Funding flexibility is the firm\'s other major area of focus at present. TransferMate has existing prepayment facilities, reverse wire processes, and direct debit arrangements. Its future plans include \"push-to-card\" payments and further developing more sophisticated payment initiation services, with the aim of giving businesses further control over their cash flow.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&ldquo;We\'re building onto payments initiation in that as well. And so, we have a lot of very interesting things in the roadmap that we\'ll continue to push,\" Conroy said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Scalable, Secure Cross-Border Payments Provider</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With its focus on compliance, innovation, and client-driven development, TransferMate remains a pioneer in cross-border payments provider. Its integration of safe multi-jurisdictional operations and adaptable payment solutions makes the company an ideal partner for international businesses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By setting both technical innovation and regulatory strength at the center of its approach, TransferMate is not merely coping with the intricacy of cross-border payments &mdash; it is redefining it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As global commerce becomes increasingly digital and decentralized, TransferMate\'s API-first approach and strong compliance platform may be the model for the future generation of cross-border payments firms.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-17', '00:36:21', 'transfermate-expands-as-trusted-cross-border-payments-provider', 'article/visionaries-network-transferMate-expands-as-trueted.webp', 'TransferMate Expands as Trusted Cross-Border Payments Provider', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-transferMate-expands-as-trueted.webp', 7, 2025, 'TransferMate, cross-border payments, international transfers, fintech, global payments, B2B payments, currency exchange, payment platform, financial services, visionaries network, payment solutions, fintech growth, trusted provider, international finance, digital payments', 'TransferMate expands its global reach as a trusted cross-border payments provider, offering secure, fast, and cost-effective international payment solutions.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(280, NULL, 'EU Rejects US DMA Advisory Body Proposal | Vsionaries Netwrok', 'EU Rejects US Plan for DMA Advisory Body in Trade Talks', 'legal and regulatory compliance', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a diplomatic move that is fueling tensions, Washington is requesting the establishment of a new DMA advisory body, requesting directly impacted companies to be listened to regarding how the regulation is applied. The request is part of broader EU-US trade negotiations but has already ignited furious resistance in Brussels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Washington Pushes for Representation</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The US would like to set up a DMA advisory body consisting of company representatives covered by the act -- specifically large American tech companies, three people familiar with the talks said. The aim, they say, is to provide a platform for the involved parties to supply directly into enforcement talks, to make the process transparent and based on mutual trust.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The DMA, which entered into force in 2023, imposes strict compliance obligations on digital \"gatekeepers\" &mdash; major online platforms such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. It aims to promote fair competition and prohibit monopolistic practices. Non-compliance can draw fines of up to 10% of a firm\'s global annual turnover.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>EU Says No Concessions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite the US suggestion, the idea of a new DMA advisory body has been scrapped by EU officials. EU officials confirmed Brussels will not be committing to the establishment of a board that would officially engage regulated companies in determining the application of the law. \"That certainly will not happen,\" one of them responded. \"There will be no US company exceptions in the DMA.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The European Commission already possesses an independent advisory board for the DMA consisting of experts and national regulators. However, it does not include any representation of the subject firms for the regulation in order to preserve the impartiality of monitoring efforts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Trade War Brewing?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This regulatory showdown is announced as transatlantic tensions rise on many fronts. Last weekend, former <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../search-result?q=donald+trump\">President Donald Trump</a></span>, poised to win the GOP nomination, threatened sweeping tariffs &mdash; 30% on EU and Mexican imports &mdash; to kick in from Aug. 1. This provoked warnings from the European Commission, which is still keen on dialogue but also ready to retaliate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Governing the virtual space is a central issue of contention in broader negotiations on trade. The US regards the DMA and its twin bill, the Digital Services Act (DSA), as thinly veiled trade barriers. The EU, however, insists that such legislation was introduced in the interests of protecting consumers and achieving level markets and not in the desire to target any specific country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Behind the Scenes: Softening of Enforcement</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A number of the EU policy experts suggest that while the rules will be stringent, the enforcement can be more diplomatic. \"To placate the US, the answer might be to settle disputes by negotiation rather than rushing to fines,\" technology adviser Christophe Carugati, based in Brussels, said. \"That will quietly \'suspend\' the investigations.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Actually, even though the probes initiated under the DMA during the last year have been pretty lenient, the fines have been modest: &euro;500 million for Apple and &euro;200 million for Meta. EU regulators contend that as the law is still in its early stages of implementation, the priority is still to get the companies into compliance mode and not to impose fines.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Simplification Ahead?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Following mounting pressure from US tech giants, the European Commission also considers more fundamental digital rule simplification. Previous month, the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and OpenAI called on the EU to make its next Code of Practice on General-Purpose AI (GPAI) \"as simple as possible.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Commission is crafting a package of digital simplification to reduce the burden on businesses &mdash; and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises &mdash; by December. But whether this drive for simplicity will impact the DMA advisory board or the DMA remains to be seen.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">EU Tech Commissioner Henna Virkkunen emphasized that Europe\'s digital rules are level and fair. \"Our rules are very fair &mdash; the same for European, American, and Chinese companies alike,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As trade negotiations heat up, the EU\'s rejection of the US draft advisory committee for a DMA is a symptom of a deeper divergence on digital rule and regulatory sovereignty. As trade negotiations remain on the table, both sides are toughening their digital red lines, and Big Tech is in the firing line.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-17', '00:46:12', 'eu-rejects-us-plan-for-dma-advisory-body-in-trade-talks', 'article/visionaries-network-eu-rejects-us-plan-for-dma.webp', 'EU Rejects US Plan for DMA Advisory Body in Trade Talks', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-eu-rejects-us-plan-for-dma.webp', 7, 2025, 'EU, US, DMA, Digital Markets Act, trade talks, advisory body, tech regulation, digital policy, visionaries network, transatlantic relations, competition law, tech giants, global trade, EU regulation, US proposal', 'The EU has rejected a U.S. proposal to form an advisory body on the Digital Markets Act during ongoing transatlantic trade negotiations.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),
(281, '', 'Social Security 2025: New Benefits Explained | Visionaries Network', 'Major Overhaul: What&rsquo;s New with Social Security Benefits in 2025?', 'banking and fintech', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Social Security Benefits in 2025 are experiencing dramatic changes to update the system and enhance equity and accessibility for millions of Americans. Such changes consist of introducing an online portal available 24/7, retroactive payments in accordance with the Social Security Fairness Act, eliminating paper checks, and a temporary tax relief for retirees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With these changes, the government is trying to update <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/quantum-ready-ai-security-for-iot-solves-key-vulnerabilities\">Social Security</a></span> for the digital era while easing burdens on beneficiaries. But questions remain about the long-term solvency of the program, with projections suggesting the trust fund may be broke within a decade.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What is Social Security?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Social Security is a government program created in 1935 to offer financial support to retired workers, disabled workers, and survivors of deceased workers. It is funded by employees\' and employers\' payroll contributions and remains a vital safety net for over 70 million Americans.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Benefits are calculated on the basis of the average lifetime earnings and work history of an individual. Apart from retirement benefits, the plan also offers disability, spousal, survivor, and dependent benefits. As the economic landscape evolves, Social Security Benefits in 2025 are both the reflection of the opportunities and challenges of the new world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>24/7 Access to the SSA Portal</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among the most highly anticipated Social Security Benefits innovations for 2025 is being able to access services online 24/7. The Social Security Administration (SSA) now has 24/7 access through an online secure portal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beneficiaries are able to update their accounts, check payment history, download necessary documents, and even correct personal details without having to sit in long phone queues or make a trip to a local office. This move towards modernization will be instrumental in cutting bureaucracy and empowering users.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Retroactive Payments: The Social Security Fairness Act</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Social Security Fairness Act then turned out to be a game-changer in early 2025. From February, the SSA started making retroactive payments to deserving government service workers who were previously hit by the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). These reforms involved back payments from as far back as January 2024.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Over $7.5 billion in overdue payments had accrued as of March 2025, averaging around $6,700 per person. The enormous one-time adjustment was followed by increases in monthly check payments, which brought relief to thousands of retirees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Goodbye Paper Checks</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Starting September 30, 2025, most Social Security recipients will no longer receive paper checks. The move toward full digitization means all benefits will be received electronically&mdash;direct deposit, prepaid debit card, or digital wallet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This reform is aimed at reducing fraud, streamlining operations, and saving mailing costs. SSA has actually exempted people who do not have banking facilities and people who have hardship exemptions. For most people, the reform is a safer and more efficient means of receiving payment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Temporary Budget Relief for the Elderly</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among the more publicity-stirring Social Security Benefit reforms of 2025 is a new tax deduction for retirees. Under a Republican-backed bill, individuals over 62 years of age and making up to $75,000 are now permitted to exclude as much as $6,000 of their taxable income&mdash;shielding some of their Social Security benefits.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This temporary tax relief, which will extend to 2029, does not exempt all benefits from taxation but gives substantial relief to low- and moderate-income retirees, especially in the case of inflation and rising healthcare costs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Looking Ahead: Stability Still in Question </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While these Social Security Benefits in 2025 adjustments are generally good, they do not address the coming funding shortfall. The Social Security Trust Fund is expected to exhaust in 2034, providing a potential need for across-the-board benefit cuts unless Congress enacts sweeping reform.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Financial planners urge Americans to consider Social Security just one piece of the retirement puzzle, not the whole puzzle. With future changes all but inevitable, it is more important than ever to remain current on current legislative and administrative developments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-18', '00:16:56', 'major-overhaul-whats-new-with-social-security-benefits-in-2025', 'article/visionaries-network-major-overhaul-new-social-security-benifits.webp', 'Major Overhaul: What&rsquo;s New with Social Security Benefits in 2025?', 'https://thesiliconreview.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-major-overhaul-new-social-security-benifits.webp', 7, 2025, 'social security 2025, new social security rules, social security changes, visionaries network, social security payments, COLA 2025', 'Discover what&rsquo;s changing with Social Security benefits in 2025 &mdash; from COLA increases to eligibility updates, payment schedules, and more.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0),

Nintendo\'s first major single-player game on the new console, Bananza is under tremendous pressure. As The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild did for the original Switch, Bananza could set the tone and standard and artistic direction for Nintendo\'s next gen. But opting to lead off with a tie-clad gorilla instead of another Super Mario Odyssey has been divisive among die-hard enthusiasts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Platformer That Breaks Through the Norm</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But Donkey Kong Bananza quickly dispels those worries&mdash;literally. The joy of the game is its frenzied genius. While initially it seems like a typical Mario 64-style 3D platformer, with theme realms and bananas to collect, the game quickly introduces its twist: nearly every surface can be destroyed. Donkey Kong does not simply move through the world&mdash;he remakes it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Destruction as Gameplay, Not Gimmick</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Armed with titanic strength and Joy-Con 2-augmented haptic feedback, Donkey Kong flattens hills into tunnels and pristine gardens into cratered battlefields. The joy of destruction is an underlying mechanic. Players pound buttons to punch walls into dust, swing massive hunks of earth like sledgehammers, and even invite a co-op buddy to increase the devastation by firing projectiles off DK\'s back. As it turns out, a lot rests on Donkey Kong Bananza not just for story resonance, but to establish a new kind of tactile and kinetic gameplay.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A New Twist on the Donkey Kong Legacy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Its breakneck pace is balanced by surprise narrative gravitas. The nefarious mining Kongs&mdash;new additions to the Kong clan&mdash;are in a hurry to find a hidden treasure buried at the center of the planet. They kidnap Pauline, the same damsel from Donkey Kong\'s coin-op origins, along the way. But it\'s no rehash: Pauline is back not as a damsel, but as a musical sidekick whose Latin-pop-infused anthems give Donkey Kong animalistic powers. One particularly infectious tune hymns \"the joy of being a zebra,\" a tribute to the game\'s skewed, surreal sense of humor.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Evolving Level Design Amidst the Chaos</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Level design is a puzzle within itself. With a universe in which the ground can be destroyed at whim, how do you design actual obstacles? The early levels are a bit too free, with treasures stumbled upon by accident rather than design. But the game tightens up as you venture into more hostile territory. Poisonous swamps, icy wastelands, and rivers of lava force you to treat the ground as if it were sacred. Kill too much, and you fall victim to your own hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Terrain-Based Combat That Demands Precision</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Boss battles are incorporated masterfully by this design, with the landscape being turned into both weapon and hindrance. Some arenas simply disintegrate beneath one\'s feet, refusing to let Donkey Kong simply bash his way through to the top. Nintendo level designers once more know how to get drama and tension out of whatever situation is at hand&mdash;no matter how seemingly one-sided the player is.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Bananzas: Brilliant or Broken?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But it is not entirely banana-smooth. The title \"Bananzas\"&mdash;animal shape transformations that grant powers like flight or super speed&mdash;is too much. While they shine on set-piece levels crafted specifically for their special powers, they become \"cheat codes\" when used in earlier levels, draining some of the tension and cleverness from the game. It\'s a strange error in a game otherwise full of invention.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Game That Lives in the Moment</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ultimately, Donkey Kong Bananza doesn\'t quite achieve that post-game feeling of discovery that made Super Mario Odyssey so wonderful, but it gives you something different: perpetual momentum, joyful mayhem, and a never-ending assault of excellent ideas. It\'s a game that pays you back in the moment and not in hours of backtracking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Nintendo gambled with investing so much in Donkey Kong as the launch headliner of its new-generation console. Yet with gameplay so <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../magazine/profile/kanconsulting-llc-fixes-business-challenges-through-innovative-ideas-and-strategies\">innovative</a></span> and world design so wild, the gamble appears to be working.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether it\'s the game people had been hoping for, a lot rests on Donkey Kong Bananza &mdash;and the big ape bears that burden with resounding success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-18', '00:43:15', 'donkey-kong-bananza-to-launch-switch-2-strong', 'article/visionaries-network-donkey-kong-bonanaza-launch-switchtwo.webp', 'Donkey Kong Bananza to Launch Switch 2 Strong', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-donkey-kong-bonanaza-launch-switchtwo.webp', 7, 2025, 'donkey kong bananza, visionaries network, nintendo switch 2 games, donkey kong 2025, new donkey kong game, nintendo console launch', 'Donkey Kong Bananza might be the key to a successful Nintendo Switch 2 debut.

The&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"https://www.astronomer.io/\">Astronomer</a></span> CEO Coldplay video, now being shared far and wide on X (formerly Twitter), TikTok, and Reddit, has social media users speculating from business ethics to leadership integrity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In now-notorious footage, CEO Andy Byron and HR manager Kristin Cabot are embracing a whole lot more than anticipated &mdash; particularly for a corporate function. When Coldplay singer Chris Martin cracked a cheeky comment to the crowd, Cabot seemed to bury her face into her shoulder and Byron hastily left the shot. But of course, it was the third in the shot that generated the most interest: Alyssa Stoddard, another Astronomer executive, who gave a discreet side-glance and knowing smile that\'s now being analyzed frame by frame.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Video That Lit the Fire</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Astronomer CEO Coldplay video was originally shared by fans who had seen the executives. Within hours, internet sleuths figured out that Stoddard was the company\'s newly minted VP of People. Fueling the fire, social media sleuths uncovered a previous LinkedIn blog post in which Cabot praised Stoddard\'s \"integrity\" and \"empathy.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Keeping in mind the videos, the majority now view the compliment as ironic. Others are even speculating that Stoddard must have known about the rumored affair between Byron and Cabot, as evidenced by her audible response and her working relationship with both.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Internet Responds: Company Remains Silent</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even while there has been immense outcry over the Astronomer CEO Coldplay video, Byron, Cabot, or Stoddard has not made a comment. Astronomer as a company has kept quiet as well &mdash; a move which is causing internal and external eyebrows to be raised.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>One tweet on X stated:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"What culture is Astronomer promoting when the CEO and HR director are cuddled up at a concert and the VP of People is just. there?\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>Another LinkedIn post was more direct:</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">\"Look at the married HR director and the married CEO out at a Coldplay show together, and the newly promoted VP of People smiling uncomfortably? This is where favoritism at work and trust breakdowns start.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Workplace Ethics in the Limelight</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Astronomer CEO Coldplay video is no longer watercooler gossip. It\'s a study in workplace ethics, especially when you have senior leadership.

(284, NULL, 'Trump&rsquo;s Diagnosis Highlights Chronic Venous Insufficiency | Visionaries network', 'Trump&rsquo;s Diagnosis Sheds Light on Chronic Venous Insufficiency in Elderly Men', 'Voice', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was on July 17, 2025, that the&nbsp;<span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/white-house-revokes-chinas-de-minimis-exemption-impacting-e-commerce-logistics\">White House</a></span> announced that former <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/is-easy-travel-still-possible-for-foreign-tourists-in-president-donald-trumps-america\">US President Donald Trump</a></span> has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a relatively common condition but often underestimated&mdash;particularly in older men. The announcement followed Trump\'s doctors examining him for swelling in his legs and eliminating more risky conditions such as heart failure or deep vein thrombosis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">While the White House insisted there was \"no evidence\" of widespread illness, the report has raised questions about chronic venous insufficiency in elderly men&mdash; an illness that is often brushed off as \"getting older\" when it can be a symptom of more advanced vascular disease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What is Chronic Venous Insufficiency?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) happens when the veins in the leg are not able to pump blood back to the heart because of the weakened or damaged vein valves. Consequently, the blood will travel backward or pool in the lower leg. This will cause swelling, leg cramps, discoloration of the skin, and, in extreme cases, ulcers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Although the condition is prevalent worldwide, chronic venous insufficiency in elderly men is especially dire. Men over the age of 60 years will develop symptoms slowly and tend to ignore them, believing that swelling or pain is part of aging. However, CVI is not destiny &mdash; and if left untreated, it will cause serious complications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Elderly Men Are Particularly Susceptible?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let\'s talk about the reality: Chronic venous insufficiency in elderly men is not diagnosed because symptoms will be minimal in the early stages. Minimal swelling, occasional cramping, or varicose veins are tolerated as minor annoyances. But such \"mild\" symptoms most likely mark the beginning of venous disease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Men in general are less apt to seek out a physician when they have such symptoms. Couple all that with risk factors of high blood pressure, obesity, inactivity, and previous leg injury, and you\'ve got a cohort that\'s very high-risk.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most men also have a previous job that entailed long periods of standing or heavy lifting &mdash; both of which narrow the leg veins. And yet, chronic venous insufficiency in older men doesn\'t make the headlines, never mind the routine check-ups.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Trump\'s Diagnosis: A Teachable Moment</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">No matter whether you\'re a supporter or a critic of Donald Trump, his diagnosis offers an opportunity for lesson-learning. The 79-year-old former President is the archetype: older age, little exercise, and the pressure of a high-profile life. Happily, his condition was discovered just in time, with no sign of blood clots or arterial disease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This public alert can generate heightened awareness about chronic venous insufficiency among older men &mdash; particularly those who do not know about the symptoms or do not have an idea that the disease exists.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It\'s an eye-opener to the public &mdash; and particularly to men of an older generation &mdash; to be aware of common leg issues.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Typical Symptoms to Observe</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency include:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Swelling of the ankles or lower legs</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Heaviness or tiredness in the legs</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Painful or cramping</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Darkening of skin near the ankles</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Varicose veins</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Burning or burning pain</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\" style=\"text-indent: -18.0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1;\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span style=\"font-family: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol;\"><span style=\"mso-list: Ignore;\">&middot;<span style=\"font: 7.0pt \'Times New Roman\';\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Open leg sores or ulcers</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These symptoms are not always present at the same time and worsen with time.

We mostly discuss heart disease, cancer, or diabetes &mdash; and rightfully so. But vascular diseases like CVI, which directly affect mobility and quality of life, are always overlooked.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Leg health affects everything from independence to sleep. CVI, if left unaddressed, can lead to chronic wounds, infection, and even hospitalization.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Trump\'s public diagnosis has inadvertently shed some light on this issue. Ideally, that light lasts long enough for others &mdash; especially older men &mdash; to listen to their symptoms and seek assistance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Final Thoughts </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Chronic venous insufficiency in older men is not on the front page of the newspaper most days, but it should be. As the case of the former President illustrates, even the most powerful men are not immune to this prevalent condition.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you or a loved one is experiencing swelling, varicose veins, or pain in the legs for no apparent reason, don\'t brush it off. Get tested. Something can be done. And like with most illnesses, early detection is the most important.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Finally, good circulation is not just good health &mdash; it\'s about maintaining freedom, comfort, and dignity in the years that really matter.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-19', '00:39:11', 'trumps-diagnosis-sheds-light-on-chronic-venous-insufficiency-in-elderly-men', 'article/visionaries-network-trump-diagnosis-chronic-venous.webp', 'Trump&rsquo;s Diagnosis Sheds Light on Chronic Venous Insufficiency in Elderly Men', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-trump-diagnosis-chronic-venous.webp', 7, 2025, 'Trump health, chronic venous insufficiency, elderly men health issues, vascular disease, visionaries network, Trump medical diagnosis, leg vein disorder, senior men&#039;s health', 'Donald Trump&rsquo;s recent diagnosis brings attention to chronic venous insufficiency, a common but often overlooked condition affecting elderly men.

The listing would be one of the first of the major crypto custodians to go public, after a period of renewed interest and regulatory clarity in the space.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The BitGo IPO filing is timed when capital markets are displaying robust signs of rebound, especially in the fintech and crypto space. Certain blue-chip companies have recently listed successfully, which is indicative of rebounding investor appetite and pent-up demand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Founded in 2013, BitGo has been deeply rooted in the cryptocurrency space, especially with its headquarters located in Palo Alto, California, providing institutional investors with secure custody solutions as a place to store and hold digital assets. In December 2023, the company raised $100 million at a valuation of $1.75 billion, demonstrating investor confidence in its infrastructure and approach.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Crypto Market Surge Drives IPO Frenzy</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The news of BitGo going public comes on the heels of explosive <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/03/crypto-etfs-approved-wall-streets-biggest-bet-on-blockchain-stocks-yet\">crypto</a></span> growth. The overall value of the global crypto market has just crossed $4 trillion last week, an all-time high. The hyper-growth has been driven by a mix of rising institutional flows, regulatory advancements in major markets, and a wave of corporate treasury onboarding of digital assets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Bitcoin, the crypto behemoth, recently surpassed the $120,000 mark, a 26% year-to-date rally. The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether, has climbed some 14% over the same period. These gains have infused new life into optimism among retail and institutional investors and have spurred companies to accelerate plans to list.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other big participants, including Grayscale and <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/06/google-launches-gemini-cli-for-easier-ai-powered-coding\">Gemini</a></span>&mdash;the Winklevoss twins-owned exchange&mdash;have also filed confidentially to list publicly, a sign of the dominant bullish sentiment.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Stablecoin Legislation Adds Fuel</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Boosting the momentum is recent U.S. regulatory advancements. President Donald Trump signed new legislation last week to oversee dollar-backed stablecoins. The bill paves the way for such digital currencies to become part of mainstream everyday transactions and cross-border payments, mainstreaming the crypto space further.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This policy shift is expected to end regulatory ambiguity and allow smoother navigation of compliance for companies like BitGo, giving a more solid foundation for growth of public and long-term investments.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>What BitGo Offers to the Table</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">BitGo\'s role within the digital currency industry is more important than ever. It is the digital version of the safety deposit box, stashing cryptocurrencies safely for institutional clients. The service is essential, especially following the high-profile hacks and security breaches against less sophisticated storage centers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Further, BitGo\'s platform enables clients to become regulatory compliant, and this renders it a choice provider for exchange, funds, and financial institutions requiring compliant and secure custody of crypto. Since institutional money continues to flow into the crypto market, the need for secure custodians like BitGo grows.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The size of the shares and pricing of the BitGo IPO are not disclosed. Nevertheless, if the listing is successful, it could be a canary in the coal mine for other such companies seeking to enter public markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Strategic Leap Amidst a Wave of Bullishness </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With this first public offering, BitGo is seeking to establish its brand, increase transparency, and raise capital that will drive future growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The company might also be in a position to make forays into new business lines and geographies, especially as crypto services demand continues to grow in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. With its long history in the space, impeccable safety record, and committed investor backing, BitGo is poised to excel in the next phase of the crypto economy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As markets increasingly find confidence and blockchain technology continues to mature, BitGo IPO filing is a smart and timely play in an increasingly volatile world.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-22', '00:49:57', 'bitgo-ipo-filing-sparks-plans-for-us-public-listing', 'article/visionaries-network-bitgo-ipo-filing-sparks-plans-us-public-listing.webp', 'BitGo IPO Filing Sparks Plans for US Public Listing', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-bitgo-ipo-filing-sparks-plans-us-public-listing.webp', 7, 2025, 'BitGo IPO, visionaries network, BitGo public listing, crypto custody IPO, BitGo US stock market, digital asset custody, crypto company IPO 2025, BitGo SEC filing, BitGo stock', 'Crypto custody firm BitGo has filed for an IPO, aiming to go public in the US.

The company is focused on expanding car access for ride-hailing drivers in five major cities: Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Tijuana, and Quer&eacute;taro.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The growth aligns with OCN\'s plan to triple its car fleet from 5,000 to 15,000 cars and expand its employees to 150 staff from 120. OCN estimates the number of gig drivers who can access cars under its scheme offering flexible car rentals with added-value services like maintenance and insurance at the thousands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Redefining Auto Access in Mexico\'s Ride-Hailing Market</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Founded in 2022 and formerly known as One Car Now, Mexican fintech OCN is set to solve a persistent problem in Mexico: the vast majority of ride-hailing drivers&mdash;over 80%&mdash;are not owners of the vehicles they drive. This is due in part to the fact that Mexico has tight financial systems that exclude informal or self-employed employees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">OCN solves this issue with a model through which gig workers can rent new cars on a week-to-week pay arrangement. They provide roadside assistance, insurance, and maintenance with the leases. Drivers may purchase the car after 36 months&mdash;a clear, tangible way to car ownership.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>CEO Stresses Financial Inclusion</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">OCN provides gig workers, who due to socioeconomic prejudice are typically turned down for auto finance despite being able to pay, with access to financial services, CEO and co-founder Mairon Sandoval stated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">He went on, \"We don\'t sell mobility&mdash;we offer a new way of making money.\" Drivers with access to their own cars are able to earn up to eight times Mexico\'s minimum wage, which makes them considerably more economically secure, Sandoval stated.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Supported by Strong Venture Capital</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The <span class=\"MsoHyperlink\"><a href=\"../../2025/05/xcel-brands-secures-9m-utg-investment-for-global-expansion\">investment</a></span> comes after a February 2025 close of a Series B funding round. The amount raised wasn\'t disclosed, but the equity component was led by Portage Ventures and the debt component by i80 Group.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The fundraising is significant because venture capital investment in Latin America is at a seven-year low, based on data from PitchBook. Uncertainty in global economies and a retreat by U.S. investors have depressed capital flows into the region.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In spite of such a daunting environment, OCN still holds investor confidence owing to its corporate social responsibility model and increasing market presence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Fostering Adoption of Electric Mobility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the past year, Mexican fintech OCN has already doubled its fleet to 5,000 vehicles, 2,000 of which are electric vehicles (EVs) of Chinese carmaker BYD Co. The growth is in line with OCN\'s mission to help speed the transition of Latin America to electric mobility, which has been slowed by the high upfront cost of EVs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By absorbing those costs and offering EVs via its rental program, OCN allows more gig workers to enjoy green transportation. \"Our goal is to make electric mobility economically viable,\" Sandoval said.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Expansion Beyond Mexico</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With a presence in 12 states of Mexico, OCN has already made a mark in the U.S. market with a presence in Texas and Florida. The biggest opportunity in the future is Brazil. The company feels that there is huge upside in Brazil\'s urban gig economy and that its model can also help drive EV uptake in South America\'s largest economy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Solid Foundation and Future Vision </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">OCN previously raised $86 million of Series A in 2024 with Caravela Capital, Collide Capital, and Great North Ventures as equity backers and again debt funding with i80 Group as backers. These rounds have provided OCN with a strong financial base to grow rapidly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With its latest investment announcement, Mexican fintech OCN will become a game-changer in Latin America\'s gig economy. By putting an end to unavailability of credit, promoting EV adoption, and providing genuine pathways to car ownership, the firm is redefining what mobility and financial inclusion mean to thousands of gig economy workers.</p>', 'visionariesnetwork Team', '2025-07-22', '00:59:05', 'mexican-fintech-ocn-to-invest-150m-to-expand-ride-hailing-fleet', 'article/visionaries-network-maxicon-fintech-ocn-invest.webp', 'Mexican fintech OCN to invest $150M to expand ride-hailing fleet', 'http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/thumb/article/visionaries-network-maxicon-fintech-ocn-invest.webp', 7, 2025, 'visionaries-network, OCN fintech investment, OCN rideâ€‘hailing expansion, Mexican fintech OCN, OCN $150M investment, rideâ€‘hailing fleet Mexico, mobility fintech Mexico, OCN growth plans, fintech transportation Mexico 2025', 'OCN, a leading Mexican fintech company, plans to invest $150 million to grow its rideâ€‘hailing fleet across Mexico&mdash;accelerating mobility and market presence.', 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

What began as a PKI consulting service has evolved into a comprehensive machine identity management platform. Over the years, the company&rsquo;s focus on empowering customers to protect and manage every machine identity hasn&rsquo;t wavered. Along the way, Keyfactor brought together best-in-class companies, people, and technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Most recently, Keyfactor merged with PrimeKey, a pioneer in open-source public key infrastructure (PKI) and signing solutions. Bringing together the most widely used PKI and certificate authority (CA) software with end-to-end machine identity management empowers its customers to securely connect and authenticate every device, workload, and application across their business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Establishing digital trust is the foundation of every digital transaction in today\'s interconnected world. With businesses operating across borders and industries, trust is crucial for speed, security, and compliance. However, fragmented PKI and certificate management tools can create inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and infrastructure complexity. Keyfactor\'s innovative approach to PKI and certificate management provides a single solution stack that streamlines digital trust establishment. This comprehensive solution empowers organizations to build, manage, and scale digital trust across all teams.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Keyfactor\'s solution offers automation of workflows and manual processes with automated PKI configuration, deployment, and certificate management. It also enables deployment of PKI as Code in Kubernetes or OpenShift with pre-built playbooks, integration with all major certificate authorities (CAs), HSMs, and cloud platforms, and ensures quantum-readiness with tools to discover and inventory assets, test NIST-selected PQC algorithms, and build a path toward migration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Keyfactor provides flexible deployment options to suit every organization\'s unique needs. Choose from software appliance, hardware appliance, containers, SaaS-delivered, or fully managed, single-tenant solution deployments. Deploy your PKI on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid model - the choice is yours.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At Keyfactor, the team understands the importance of trust and compliance. Its solutions are actively maintained to meet industry standards and regulations, including Common Criteria/NIAP, ISO 27001, PCI DSS 3.2, and SOC 2 Type II for hosted customers. The company&rsquo;s open-source PKI and signing solutions are widely adopted by a global community of thousands of developers and PKI practitioners. The company&rsquo;s in-house experts develop and support the popular Bouncy Castle cryptography APIs, enabling customers to build quantum-ready and FIPS-certified applications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Keyfactor prioritizes open standards over proprietary integrations, ensuring seamless integration with all major CAs, HSMs, and cloud platforms. Its solutions support open-source frameworks and popular protocols like ACME, EST, CMP, CMPv2, Matter, and more.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the threat of quantum computers looms closer, Keyfactor is at the forefront of quantum-readiness. Keyfactor&rsquo;s customers are already equipped with tools to discover and inventory assets, test NIST-selected PQC algorithms, and build a path toward migration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">EJBCA Enterprise is Keyfactor\'s flagship PKI solution that provides a complete turnkey PKI experience. With EJBCA Enterprise, organizations can deploy their PKI as a turnkey software appliance, hardware appliance, in the cloud, as a service (SaaS PKI), or in a hybrid model. They can issue identities for every device, workload, and user; integrate with any application or use case via support for multiple formats, protocols, and algorithms; configure fine-tuned controls over certificate profiles, extensions, approval workflows, and validation from one console; run their entire PKI on a single instance; scale up on-demand without infrastructure complexity; and simplify audits with detailed signed audit logs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"border: none; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\"><strong>Short bio of Jordan Rackie, Chief Executive Officer</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"border: none; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\">Jordan Rackie is the chief executive officer at Keyfactor.

Etumos can help.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Etumos Approach</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How Etumos builds solutions meeting marketing operations needs of today but also anticipating the future state of business.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Etumos Philosophy</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Marketing Operations is a specialized profession with specialized skills needed.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Team &amp; Leaders</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Etumos, the team of growing Marketing Operations experts is relentless in pursuit of excellence so you smash your marketing goals.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Careers</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\'re passionate about what\'s next in marketing technology and innovation, let\'s start a conversation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>S-C-R-I-M Spells Success</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This Etumos team seems to have a very different way of approaching how they think about the right solutions to fit business. Etumos calls these guiding principles the SCRIM Design Methodology.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SCRIM stands for Scalable, Clear, Robust, Intelligent, and Modular. At Etumos, SCRIM is a mantra, and it\'s at the heart of how Etumos designs integration solutions, configures platforms, and architects campaign flows&hellip;. you get the picture. It is in everything.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Not quite sure what Etumos means?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Scalable:</strong> The solution should perform similarly well at 10x the size.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Clear:</strong> How the solution has to be understandable, and reduced potential for confusion, errors built into it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Robust: </strong>All functional requirements are covered with the solution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Intelligent: </strong>The solution takes care of upstream and downstream processes; there is no concept of \"silent errors\" baked into it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Modular: The solution is designed to do one function and can be easily maintained or decoupled without hurting the other componentry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Automation and Integration Services for Marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Etumos, it is known that you can\'t afford to waste hours trying to solve problems technology should solve for you. You need to go beyond those limited integrations that come with your applications. Etumos can design and deliver the right technical solutions that support better martech integration, better data flow, and more efficient campaign execution, all while providing a single source of truth for customer data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Connect Systems</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When integrations between your platforms don\'t quite fit your unique needs out-of-the-box, Etumos can facilitate the planning and implementation of the right structure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Automate Everything</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Schedule data Imports, implement and manage middleware, create triggered events between systems, and reduce the team\'s manual work getting data across platforms.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Manage In-House Dev Resources</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Etumos speaks to dev and marketing ops so they can help translate marketing business requirements to the dev team and manage QA outcomes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Use the Marketing Data You Collect and Pay For</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With great data and automation at the core of strong marketing practice, it\'s little wonder organizations are adding new technologies to their martech stacks at breakneck pace. The outcome is petabytes of valued data, captured but not necessarily making it across the stack to drive engagement and conversion. This is attributed to the fact that integration and developer resources are not available for identifying technology-centric opportunities, which can integrate martech stacks.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Preference Management Should Not Become a Full-Time Job</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Management of email preferences between systems and platforms can be an activity that turns to full-time work within a large and complex martech stack. You will then be able to centralize these preferences in one place using the iPaaS tools so you can stay in compliance with all global privacy laws while reducing manual work.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How Etumos Helps You Get More from Your Martech Stack</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies are bridging this chasm&mdash;laborious manual processes&mdash;with a dearth of integration guidance and development skills, which prevents them from swinging into action effectively to engage prospects. Etumos can help get the majority of the systems to a more scalable place while removing the threat of future tech debt with technology integration services. How Etumos can help:</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&bull; Value-prioritized auditing systems and recommending opportunities for integration</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&bull; Technical and architectural guidance in vendor selection</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&bull; Creating custom integrations and workflow automation</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&bull; Better sync timing between systems</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Marketing Automation Consulting</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Etumos, it is known that you can\'t afford to waste valuable time trying to solve problems that technology should solve for you. You need to go beyond the limited integrations that come with your applications. Etumos is going to design and deliver the right technical solution that will allow you to see better martech integration, better data flow, more efficient campaign execution, and centralized customer data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>HubSpot Consulting</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Process Creation:</strong> Etumos\' patented Framework applies team best practices to create, within HubSpot, repeatable and scalable operational processes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Campaign Execution: </strong>Manage the end-to-end campaign build process with Etumos inside of HubSpot for repeatable and scalable processes to reduce errors and time-to-market.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Campaign Metrics &amp; Analytics:</strong> Connect your CRM to the processes in HubSpot for a complete view of your inbound pipeline.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Edward Unthank, Founder</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a renowned marketeer, Unthank is a triple Marketo Champion, leader of the Seattle MUG, and thought-leader in the MOPs community.

Founded in 2015 by Grant and Marc, Replicated has emerged as a modern solution for delivering and managing multi-prem software. The company\'s container-based platform enables software vendors to quickly deploy cloud-native applications inside customers\' environments, providing greater security and control.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the heart of Replicated\'s platform is the ability to distribute software to enterprise customers of all sizes, regardless of the complexity of their environments. This is achieved through a unified platform that brings together everything needed to efficiently manage, test, install, support, and measure the distribution of an application.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Replicated Platform is designed with a comprehensive suite of features that significantly streamline the management of software applications and enhance the overall experience for software vendors. One of the standout components of this platform is the Vendor Portal, which serves as a centralized hub for vendors to efficiently oversee their applications, manage releases, and monitor customer licenses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This portal not only simplifies administrative tasks but also empowers vendors with valuable insights into their applications\' performance. Through the Vendor Portal, vendors can access critical data regarding uptime and usage metrics, enabling them to make informed decisions and optimize their offerings. Additionally, the platform provides tailored support packages for each customer setup, ensuring that vendors can deliver personalized assistance and maintain strong relationships with their clients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another key feature of the Replicated Platform is the Compatibility Matrix, which plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle. This tool is particularly beneficial for software vendors as it allows them to rigorously test their applications in environments that closely replicate their customers\' setups. By integrating the Compatibility Matrix into their continuous integration (CI) processes, vendors can identify potential compatibility issues early on, thereby reducing the risk of deployment failures and enhancing the overall reliability of their applications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The matrix offers a ready-made infrastructure that supports testing across a variety of Kubernetes distributions, versions, and configurations. This flexibility ensures that vendors can validate their applications against a wide range of environments, ultimately leading to a more robust and versatile product.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process of using the Compatibility Matrix is straightforward. Software vendors can define their testing strategy by integrating Replicated\'s actions or CLI into their CI process. They can then choose combinations of distros, versions, and configurations, and set up their own smoke tests, policy tests, release tests, and canary tests on the provisioned infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"http://www.visionariesnetwork.com/story_image_upload/us/Replicated-grant-miller-founder-ceo-cover.jpg\" width=\"154\" height=\"211\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to its testing capabilities, the Replicated Platform also provides a Kubernetes Installer that enables software vendors to embed Kubernetes with their application. This allows customers to install the application with a simple click-and-go operation, even in environments with VMs and bare metal hardware.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Replicated SDK provides a way for software vendors to integrate their application with the Replicated Platform. This enables them to provide license enforcement, reporting, and update information to customers. The Customer Portal provides each customer with access-controlled instructions on how to install the latest version of the application.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Replicated\'s platform also offers a range of tools for troubleshooting issues within existing customer environments. The Compatibility Matrix can test across 65,981+ unique configuration combinations, giving software vendors complete confidence that their applications will run without issues in customers\' unique environments.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to its core features, Replicated\'s platform also offers integration with Helm, a popular package manager for Kubernetes. The company\'s Enhanced Helm solution provides a unified platform that brings together everything needed to complement Helm installs, manage app lifecycles, and embed Replicated\'s advanced capabilities in an application.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Enhanced Helm solution provides a range of benefits for software vendors, including improved install success rates, accelerated support issue resolution, and greater insights into customer usage. It also enables software vendors to embed Replicated transparently in their applications, providing a fully transparent and white-labeled application lifecycle experience for customers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Grant Miller, Founder &amp; CEO</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&ldquo;We power your install options that will meet your customers&rsquo; requirements and Kubernetes comfort level (or lack thereof).&rdquo;</strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 'replicated-the-best-way-to-distribute-your-software-to-customers', '2022-05-05', 'us/visionaries-network-grant--miler-founder-ceo-replicated.webp', 1001, 'cover', 'Distribute Software Easily with Replicated', 'Replicated, software distribution, air-gap, Kubernetes, enterprise, SaaS, deployment, on-prem, DevOps, CI/CD, Docker, security, scalability, visionaries network, automation', 'Replicated simplifies software delivery to all customers, even in complex, air-gapped environments.

Readily scalable, add new users and functionality &ndash; all without the need for expensive IT resources. The SAP ERP Solutions delivered by Navigator Business Solutions provide predictable pricing, seen as an operating expense, not a capital expense. All so you can focus on your business growth &ndash; and not on IT and back office processes.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ERP is an industry term for the broad suite of completely integrated solutions that help businesses manage the central functions of their business such as purchasing and inventory management. SAP applications SAP Business One, SAP Business ByDesign, and SAP S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, go well beyond the basic core functions of accounting and inventory, delivering a complete, robust suite covering all aspects of business management including Human Resources, Financials, Analytics, Supply Chain, Project Management, CRM, and more.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The industry is moving quickly to cloud computing as it provides a greater opportunity for businesses to completely transform how they use and pay for information technology. For example, cloud-based (SaaS) ERP applications eliminate the need for a business to purchase additional servers and storage hardware and maintain them on-site which, in turn, reduces operational expenses.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Chris M.

As the market continues to evolve, companies are seeking innovative ways to stay ahead of the curve and provide high-quality products that meet the growing demands of consumers. Riverleaf Biotech Industries LLC, a leading provider of hemp-derived products and extracts, is poised to play a significant role in shaping the future of the CBD industry through its commitment to collaboration, innovation, and quality.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Riverleaf Biotech Industries LLC, the team is dedicated to creating a new standard for CBD products by mirroring the standards of production found in pharmaceutical laboratories. By controlling every step of the process, from plant to product, the company ensures that a strict level of quality control is implemented at all stages. This commitment to quality is reflected in the company\'s adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), ISO, USDA, and FDA standards, as well as its pursuit of certifications in these areas.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the key ways that Riverleaf Biotech Industries LLC is working to shape the future of the CBD industry is through its wholesale partnership options.

In addition to white labeling, Riverleaf Biotech Industries offers a hemp toll processing service, which provides a flexible and cost-effective solution for customers looking to convert their hemp biomass into high-quality CBD extracts. This service allows businesses to utilize their own raw materials while benefiting from Riverleaf\'s advanced processing capabilities and industry knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By outsourcing the extraction process, companies can focus on their core competencies, such as marketing and distribution, while ensuring that they receive premium CBD extracts that meet industry standards.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to its wholesale partnership options, Riverleaf Biotech Industries LLC is also committed to supporting research and development in the CBD industry.

In truth, there are literally thousands of marketing channels and strategies a business can follow. No wonder most businesses do not know where to begin in making it all make any sense. What if you could tame the monster of marketing and be confident about meeting your objectives? Welcome to Storm Cloud Marketing.<br><br>Storm Cloud Marketing has been a trusted partner for businesses since 1998, guiding them through the often complex and challenging landscape of marketing.

Consultus Digital is the leading innovator in the digital marketing and sales enablement space; it renews how businesses look toward growth by offering pioneering solutions with results. Its unique blend of data, technology, and psychology powers Consultus Digital in accelerating business growth and reaching revenue targets for businesses.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Breaking Away from the Traditional Model</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until Consultus Digital came up with this innovative approach, the conventional way of growing revenues was to generate more leads through different marketing strategies. Often, conventional ways bore little fruit. After having worked for years with hundreds of companies, one thing was clear: an increase in the volume of leads did not actually mean an increase in either sales or revenue. The reason was simple: antiquated sales systems were letting leads go to waste.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consultus Digital knew developing a modern, scalable digital sales model complements digital marketing strategies. Since the company also has solutions for both digital marketing and sales functions, the two strategies could be aligned, ensuring performance in an optimal manner.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital Strategy Services that Steal the Spotlight</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consultus Digital offers bespoke digital marketing strategies to help businesses stay ahead of the competition.

The company then looks for experts who can assist the client in laying a foundation by developing a website, among other things, and creating an overall digital marketing strategy.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once the ground is laid, Consultus Digital works on lead acquisition through integrated inbound marketing strategies: search engine optimization, Google Ads, social media, and reputation management. The only thing that this company focuses on is performance marketing to increase leads and sales.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Selling and Modifying</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After a lead generation, Consultus Digital undertakes the work of optimizing sales performance for clients. The organization introduces modern sales methodologies and technologies for the sales teams that provide the resources they need to close deals at a better rate.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This incorporation of the whole practice within the CRM sales data of clients allows Consultus Digital to measure each and every campaign\'s effectiveness and to further evolve their strategies toward optimal performance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Jake Matzanke, Director of Strategy</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jake Matzanke, Director of Strategy and Partner at Consultus Digital, has spent over a decade in digital marketing and sales, working with hundreds of organizations. However, he has come to realize that there is a significant gap in his industry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What\'s that gap, you ask? It\'s the fact that many businesses he has worked with focus solely on generating leads, hoping that this will lead to increased revenue. But, all too often, new leads don\'t necessarily translate to increased sales or revenue. Jake has discovered that many of these companies lack modern sales processes, such as CRM systems, lead-flow routing, and automation. Additionally, they often miss opportunities to generate significant returns through cross-selling and up-selling to existing clients.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jake has found that the traditional agency-client model only scratches the surface of what\'s needed to drive meaningful growth for these businesses. That\'s why he founded Consultus Digital - a unique blend of agency and consultancy services.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Consultus Digital, Jake takes a holistic approach to business growth. He immerses himself in his clients\' operations, transforming their sales and marketing strategies from the ground up.

(46, 4, '<p><strong>Summit Digital Marketing\'s mission is to help its clients get found online and increase their reach, revenue, and impact</strong></p>', '<p><img class=\"img-responsive magazine-profile-image\" alt=\"\">In today\'s digital age, having a strong online presence is crucial for businesses of all sizes and industries. With the rise of the internet and social media, customers are now more likely to search for products and services online rather than relying on traditional methods such as word of mouth or print advertisements. As a result, businesses that don\'t have a solid digital marketing strategy in place are at risk of falling behind their competitors and losing potential customers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Benefits of Digital Marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital marketing offers numerous benefits for businesses, including increased brand awareness, improved website traffic, and enhanced customer engagement. By having a professional website and engaging in various digital marketing activities, businesses can showcase their products and services to a wider audience, increasing their chances of attracting new customers and driving sales. Additionally, digital marketing provides businesses with valuable insights into customer behavior, allowing them to make data-driven decisions and optimize their marketing strategies for better results.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Pay-Per-Click Advertising (PPC)</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most effective forms of digital marketing is pay-per-click (PPC) advertising. PPC allows businesses to create targeted ads that appear on search engines and other websites, directing users to their website. With PPC, businesses only pay when a user clicks on their ad, making it a cost-effective way to generate leads and drive sales. By using keywords and targeting specific demographics, PPC campaigns can be highly targeted, allowing businesses to reach their ideal audience and increase their chances of conversion.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another important aspect of digital marketing is search engine optimization (SEO). SEO involves optimizing a website\'s content and structure to improve its visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). By using keywords and phrases strategically, creating high-quality content, and building high-quality backlinks, businesses can improve their website\'s ranking on search engines and increase their visibility to potential customers. With SEO, businesses can attract organic traffic and establish themselves as authority figures in their industry.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Google Ads Management</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google Ads is one of the most popular forms of PPC advertising, allowing businesses to create targeted ads that appear on Google search results pages. With Google Ads management, businesses can create custom campaigns that target specific demographics, interests, and behaviors. By using Google Ads analytics tools, businesses can track the performance of their campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimize their ads for better results.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Paid Media Marketing</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paid media marketing involves using paid advertising channels such as social media platforms, online directories, and email marketing to promote a business\'s products or services. With paid media marketing, businesses can reach a wider audience and increase their brand awareness by targeting specific demographics and interests. By using paid media marketing analytics tools, businesses can track the performance of their campaigns and make data-driven decisions to optimize their ads for better results.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Digital Marketing Consulting</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, digital marketing consulting involves providing expert advice and guidance to businesses looking to improve their digital marketing strategies. With digital marketing consulting, businesses can get personalized recommendations for improving their online presence, increasing their website traffic, and driving sales. By working with experienced digital marketing consultants, businesses can gain valuable insights into the latest digital marketing trends and best practices.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Roman, Founder &amp; CEO</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ten years ago, Summit Digital Marketing was a one-Roman show! Fueled by his vision to change lives through marketing, Roman created Summit with no intention of hiring employees (and yet here Summit Digital Marketing is!). Like any Founder and CEO, Roman has worn a lot of hats over the years. After graduating from the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago with the intent to become a youth pastor, Roman felt called by God instead to help people through entrepreneurship and business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today he&rsquo;s doing just that and is beyond grateful for the relationships, impact, and opportunities that have come with this journey. Outside of Summit, Roman is a loving husband and father of two girls. He loves snowboarding, golfing, hosting parties, and rooting for the Vikings. His perfect day?

The AI guiding all this has been specifically trained on the vagaries of product manufacture and maintenance, as well as conversation, to ensure that customers receive just the right information in very plain speech.<br><br>One of the features of the support solution through Mavenoid is its possibility to answer based on already existing support content or to design guided flows that would give detailed step-by-step instructions. This is an option of flexibility in the approach, letting the brand go for the one that suits the needs and preferences of its customers.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another interesting feature is Vision Assist, which gives the user ability to simply scan ingeniously a product label through their phone or tablet to accurately identify the product when troubleshooting, registering for warranties, or ordering replacement parts.<br><br>For those issues that are more complicated and require human intervention, Mavenoid\'s Virtual Assistant easily fits into the ticketing workflows from platforms such as Zendesk, Salesforce, and others. This empowers agents to take over from where the AI has left off or continue to work with customers using their favorite channels.<br><br>The AI-powered content retrieval enables Mavenoid to help customers more effectively search through product documentation for the answers they need, saving them more than 50% on time per ticket. Therefore, the customer dissatisfaction reduces and it increases the productivity and efficiency level of the agent.<br><br>The feedback of agents is ingested by the Mavenoid AI while tickets are being resolved, in order to self-develop customer support flows in the direction of more self-service and the further elevation of resolution rates from automated tickets. A constant feedback loop ensures the continuous development and improvement of the support experience.<br><br>Another game-changer in the Mavenoid arsenal is One-Click Interactive Video Support. The agents can pause, zoom, and draw on a feed so that they can intuitively walk customers through complicated instructions. In summary, this makes the complex troubleshooting a breeze.<br><br>Use of a Dynamic Help Center will enable the management of problems before they turn into tickets: access to personalized support content&mdash;as necessitated by any customer&mdash;refers to FAQs, product manuals, video tutorials, and step-by-step guides.<br><br>And because global brands need to localize and create content in over 50 languages, Dynamic Help Center eases their burdens of managing support knowledge. Agents can also log into their own Help Center to be able to share personalized solutions with customers in a snap.<br><br>Beyond that, with this AI-based support solution, you can get insights into customer behavior and preferences that often only other brands would dream of. They can track cases of self-service and live support resolution, the performance of each piece of support content, and when customers abandon a troubleshooting flow&mdash;all from one dashboard.<br><br>Besides, the Insights module of Mavenoid provides valuable data on customer behavior, which will help in identifying common anomalies in product operation or issues about which customers are getting confused. That information can be used to improve products and services geared toward customer support, changing this cost into a profit generator.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&ldquo;Our purpose-built technology delivers best-in-class customer support with intelligent troubleshooting and personalized remote support that delivers resolution rates of 58% and up.&rdquo;</strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 'mavenoid-is-the-intelligent-support-platform-specifically-designed-for-products-and-devices', '2023-05-20', 'us/visionaries-network-gintautas-miliauskas-ceo.webp', 5, 'profile', 'Intelligent Product Support Platform | Mavenoid', 'Mavenoid, intelligent support, product support, device support, AI support platform, customer service, automated help, troubleshooting, technical support, self-service, chatbot, support tools, tech support, visionaries network, product assistance', 'Mavenoid is the intelligent support platform built for products and devices, enabling fast, automated, and scalable customer support solutions.', NULL, 1, 'no', 'https://www.mavenoid.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/mavenoid/', 'Mavenoid', '2017', 'Stockholm'),

(56, 5, '<p><strong>Access Infinity aims to streamline decision-making and strategy development across a pharma product&rsquo;s life cycle</strong></p>', '<p><img class=\"img-responsive magazine-profile-image\" alt=\"\">The pharmaceutical industry is indeed going through a phase of great change, mainly due to increasing demand for better efficiency and effectiveness in developing and distributing medicines. This is what several factors bring about: the escalations of cost in healthcare, the need for personalized medicine, and the enhanced importance of regulatory compliance. In such a scenario, pharmaceutical companies have no choice but to rethink their century-old practices and implement innovative strategies to compete in the market.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the significant reasons for this shift is the pressure to reduce the time and cost involved in bringing new drugs into the market. It is estimated that the time needed to bring drugs to the market exceeds ten years, which is also expensive and runs into billions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this way, companies have to make their operations faster and more efficient. This has led to the adaptation of sophisticated technologies such as artificial intelligence machine learning, and big data analytics as R&amp;D processes can be greatly improved using these technologies. Companies can quickly identify potential drug candidates and optimize the design of clinical trials, enhancing recruitment as well as retention of patients.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company Access Infinity is a consultancy firm that initially began offering services in 2014 for pharmaceutical firms to find their way in the path that will propel them forward into new challenges. It started by providing the strategies and means of attaining market access as well as its appropriate pricing for pharma businesses. As the company progressed, so did its offerings; over the years, Access Infinity expanded for innovative digital tools-from Access Hub, and Evidence Hub, to Nuro-to aid decisions and strategy development at every stage of a product\'s life cycle.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The heart of Access Infinity\'s approach is built upon a foundation of collaboration, excellence, and care. The company values are encapsulated in this trinity, guiding it in work with clients and employees in the same manner. Whether it\'s culture-building, hard work dedicated to excellence, or being really concerned about the well-being of both its employees and clients, Access Infinity has only the best of results in store.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The innovation that Access Infinity introduces to the market, in relation to a powerful digital platform, involves eliciting data-based insights on everything from pricing to clinical trials to HTA, or Health Technology Assessment. Users can access all the information in one place, compare and contrast the data points side by side, and export insights in a range of formats. It is a very potent tool meant to support pharma companies in making more informed decisions and ultimately in staying ahead of their competition.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Yet another addition to the Access Infinity portfolio is Evidence Hub, the continuously updated library of value messages and evidence. Through that channel, users collect and catalog all the support evidence of an asset\'s value story: getting automatic updates and a living evidence base for your asset. Such innovative solution helps streamline processes in evidence management by pharma companies while they make more informed choices about their products.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As one of the leading market access consultancy firms, Infinity has an exceptionally good experience working with its customers to deliver over 1,500 projects and support over 250 brands that have entered the market. The firm extends its reach across three continents and currently engages more than 40 market access consultants in over 40 countries. The strong network of this firm therefore provides it with unmatched insights and support supplied to the clients.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not only does Access Infinity\'s team consist of experts and global reach, but also great skills and attention to detail.

They believe that by working together, they can help you achieve your goals in the most efficient way possible.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Is Your Business Having Growing Pains?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you\'re experiencing growing pains in your business, Deep Fork Technology is here to help. It&rsquo;s custom solutions can help simplify your process, keep up with growth, and move away from spreadsheets.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Simplifying Your Process</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When starting out, businesses often use multiple pre-built solutions to manage different aspects of their process. However, as they grow, these solutions can become restrictive and difficult to manage. Deep Fork Technology&rsquo;s custom solutions can help you streamline your process, eliminating the need for multiple software solutions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Keeping Up with Growth</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As your business grows, it\'s essential to have a scalable platform that can keep up with your needs. Deep Fork Technology can help you build an employee management, onboarding, or time management platform that will be adaptable to your future growth.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Moving Away from Spreadsheets</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spreadsheets are often used to track data when businesses are starting out. However, as they grow, these spreadsheets can become cumbersome and difficult to manage. Deep Fork Technology can help you build a centralized portal where you can organize and track data from anywhere.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why Build Applications in 2023?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In today\'s market, mobile and web applications are crucial for success. Having an easily accessible platform that connects employees, manages processes, and generates sales on any device means business efficiency can be at an all-time high.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reasons to Build Applications in 2023:</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Scalable Platform for Future Integrations: Having a simple platform that covers only a small portion of your process is restrictive. That\'s why Deep Fork Technology delivers a sturdy platform for future features to easily fit into.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Better Experience for Customers: Having services available on both mobile and desktop devices is a great way to engage with more customers. Web application development allows for better user experience and access to more complex functionality than normal web pages allow.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Easy Access to Business Data While Offline: Having a system like time-tracking or job management that can be done offline is perfect for businesses that need to track data in an offline environment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Needing Functionality Only an App Can Handle: Native mobile apps offer access to native device features like geolocation, notifications, local storage, and more!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Service Targeted to Mobile Users: Sometimes businesses like Uber offer a service that is only available on mobile devices. If you have a great app idea, having a free consultation with people who were once in your shoes is a great idea.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Why Get Web Design &amp; Development in 2023?</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There\'s no question that your website is one of the most important aspects of business marketing today. But just having a website isn\'t enough. According to web credibility research from Stanford University, 75% of consumers judge a company\'s credibility based on the company\'s web design.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Reasons to Get Web Design &amp; Development in 2023</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The site is Not Mobile-Friendly: Over 55% of internet browsing occurs on mobile devices, and according to Google, 61% of users are unlikely to return to a site on mobile if it isn\'t fully responsive.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ranking Very Low in Search Engines: One of the most important parts of a website is Search Engine Optimization (SEO). If users can\'t find your site, it won\'t matter how much great content is found on it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The site is Loading Very Slowly: According to researchers, slow-loading websites cost retailers $2.6 billion in lost sales each year. Site speed is vital when trying to convert and keep users engaged.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Conversions are Low</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Needing to increase your conversion rate is a great reason to create or update an existing website. Once Deep Fork Technology has a clear understanding of who your target audience is, it can work to figure out the best way to convert them.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Needing a Slick Template</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A big portion of Deep Fork Technology web design clients come to us with an outdated-looking site. Researchers found that 38% of users will stop engaging with a website that has an unattractive layout. If your website looks like it was made in the early 2000\'s, you are losing out on sales.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Kris Dillon, Founder</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Coming from a background of holding a CEO position for multiple corporate-sized companies, over time I felt that something just wasn\'t right.

In service of this, the company is committed to inspiring and equipping small businesses to lead on climate mitigation. Pioneering climate solutions, Aclymate has created a holistic platform for small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs) to measure, track, offset, reduce, and report on their emissions in pursuit of a net-zero future.<br><br><strong>The Beginning of the Journey</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aclymate co-founder and CEO, Mike Smith, began his journey with Aclymate when, as a young lad, he had an awakening about the forces of climate change. He watched forests burn down in his backyard as a child and was told that nature would slowly heal itself; but when he returned to his childhood hometown, 20 years later, the forests hadn\'t grown back. This made Mike feel urgent and responsible to do something; thus, he turned into an advocate for mitigating climate change.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, Mike\'s journey introduced him to William Loopesko, the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Aclymate. Will loved animals and the outdoors and had a developing product that had to do with measuring the temperature of dogs. The two entrepreneurs met through an entrepreneurs\' group, and hit it off, with a common dream of making climate change accessible to all.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Solution Aclymate</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aclymate\'s platform is designed especially for SMBs needing an all-in-one climate solution. At the core of the platform lie the three steps: Measure, Reduce, and Offset.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Measure: Aclymate\'s carbon accounting tool makes use of the GHG to measure and track emissions. The platform is integrated with major accounting software and utility companies for ease of gathering data. Users can also upload spreadsheets of additional information as needed.<br>Thanks to Aclymate\'s class-leading reporting functionality, enterprises are able to find hotspots-quick, easy reductions can be made. The intuitive reports present actionable insights for enterprises in light of decisions taken in consonance with real data.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Offset: Aclymate\'s marketplace presents a wide range of offset options from around the world. Users are free to browse and select offsets that are in tandem with their values and goals.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Certifications and Compliance</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aclymate\'s solution provides a way for businesses to achieve a number of certifications and compliances: for example, B Corp. The carbon accounting feature with Aclymate and the reporting feature help an organization in quantifying Scopes 1, 2, and 3 under the GHG protocol and reporting it. Third-party verification of the emission reports features on the platform; it also enables setting a net-zero target and defining the climate transition plan.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&bull; Ecovadis: Aclymate, with the help of customized reporting, helped clients increase their assessment scores in Ecovadis and achieve the Platinum level of such a prominent certification.<br>&bull; Green Business Benchmark: The reporting required for GBB Certification is included out-of-the-box within the Aclymate solution, and hence it is easy for any organization to get points toward GBB certification.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Values at Aclymate</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At Aclymate, integrity, equality, balance, and action are the guiding stars. Sustainability for this company is not only the reduction of emissions but also respect for people, and their empowerment to make decisions. Aclymate has a low hierarchy that pretty much allows team members to work collaboratively and innovatively, and pays balanced attention to work-life balance.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Mike Smith, Founder &amp; CEO</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We measure the emissions across your life - at work, home, and events - to help you identify, reduce, offset, and report your climate pollution.

The company is headquartered across three countries with a go-to-market team located in the U.S. for developing a pioneer solution targeted at opening up this subsequent era of non-interruptive video ads. Rembrand empowers creators to unlock new value from the content they share without having to compromise on viewer experience through seamless integration of AI-driven technology.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the vision of Rembrand, there is something that remains central: to inlay brands in people\'s favorite content in a way that would offer a much more sustainable, effective form of advertising to both brands and consumers. It is based on imagination, creativity, and passion for innovation, and Rembrand believes AI can unlock new possibilities within the process of content creation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This way, brands reach out to their target audiences in ways that respect the audiences\' attention. Its values are seen in the commitment to respect the viewers\' experience by ensuring that ads are not disruptive or annoying but become a part of the content. It is from this innovative venture that the Rembrand Marketplace is born, in which the best worldwide creators provide high-quality content for any brand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity allows brands to weave their message or product into powerful videos using special animations to grab attention and narrate a story. It is never possible to skip, ignore or be distracted if it\'s Rembrand\'s creative units; they will always create maximum impact. By using AI-driven technology, the company allows brands to reach their target audience very precisely: it aggregates the free flow of high-quality content created by top creators around the world that serves niche markets and demographics.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Rembrand\'s platform monetizes for creators: the ability to supplement sponsored posts with targeted in-scene media. Target media can be embedded post-production, and with the Rembrand post-production solution, this can be done across their entire content library. This creates greater chances to generate more revenue for the creators and gives them greater content flexibility, where they can really focus on storytelling rather than being limited by commercial considerations.\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For brands, Rembrand enables targeted reach with high-quality, resonant content; the ability to insert a message or a product within engaging videos without disturbing the viewer experience; and measurable results through advanced analytics and reporting. AI technology found at the heart of Rembrand is what drives innovation in speed, scale, realism, and efficiency within video advertising.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traditional VFX product insertion can take weeks; Rembrand\'s AI does it in hours. The platform processes huge volumes of content, doncipi thousands of creators and brands a day. What\'s more, Rembrand\'s AI is not only tradable with the laws of physics but also understands the detection of the environment, surfaces, and camera angles to realistically place media objects within a video scene. This level of realism ensures that the ads are indistinguishable from the content they interrupt and, as a result, reduces the time and cost spent on production while interest is heightened.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Rembrand continues to raise the bar for innovation in AI-driven video advertising, this one looks fixed to define the industry\'s future. With its innovative approach and cutting-edge technology, Rembrand is changing the way brands engage with audiences and creators monetize audience content. Whether a brand wants to connect with its target audience or a creator is looking for additional monetization opportunities, Rembrand will introduce new ways of thinking about video advertising. It accomplishes this by taking advantage of the best that AI and groundbreaking technology have to offer, allowing Rembrand to set the place and definition of what is possible in video advertising.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Omar Tawakol, Chief Executive Officer</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rembrand is co-founded by 20-year tech executive, Omar Tawakol, who also serves as the company\'s seasoned leadership. He has held several notable positions, including Vice President and General Manager of Cisco\'s Contact Center business unit. Before that, he founded and led Voicea, a pioneering voice-based AI assistant platform that was recently acquired by Cisco. His entrepreneurship drive is further exhibited in the founding and chieftaincy of BlueKai&mdash;the largest consumer data marketplace globally&mdash;acquired by Oracle in 2014. Before that, he had robust experience in tech while working in industry giants like Google, Salesforce, and Microsoft. He has an MSc in Computer Science from Stanford and an undergraduate degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>&ldquo;We offer a Marketplace and a Platform that enables advertisers to become part of the story, rather than interrupting it.&rdquo;</strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 'rembrand-is-the-worlds-leading-platform-for-enhanced-in-scene-advertising', '2022-05-14', 'us/visionaries-network-omar-tawakol-ceo-rembrand.webp', 2, 'profile', 'Rembrand: Leader in Enhanced In-Scene Advertising', 'Rembrand, in-scene advertising, digital ads, AI, marketing tech, virtual ads, media, innovation, branding, visionaries network, content monetization, advertising platform, real-time, immersive, technology', 'Rembrand is the global leader in enhanced in-scene advertising, using AI to deliver immersive, real-time brand integration across digital content.', NULL, 1, 'no', 'https://www.rembrand.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/getrembrand/?viewAsMember=true', 'Rembrand', '2022', 'Los Altos, California, USA'),

However, with Nitrogen, advisors and firms can transform these fearful investors into fearless ones, making informed decisions that drive long-term financial success.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">At the heart of this platform is a customer-driven approach, where firms prioritize delivering exceptional results and exceeding client expectations. This means being bold in their approach, thinking from the perspective of fearless investing, and focusing on making a meaningful impact on both firms and investors.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">The platform is built on the principles of the Heart of a Champion, which includes executing with a growth mindset, innovating, being curious, and compounding every day. This mindset is driven by a passion for winning for customers, teammates, and investors. The team is comprised of leaders who own quality outcomes, prioritize team over ego, and are all-in when it comes to achieving a common goal.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">Authentic transparency is also a core value of Nitrogen. This means open, direct, respectful, and transparent communication that sets the right expectations and builds trust with clients. The platform\'s reputation is built on objective methodology, never compromising on its values or principles.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">One of the key features of the Nitrogen is the Risk Number, which provides a scientific framework for assessing risk tolerance. This framework won the Nobel Prize for Economics and helps investors understand the relationship between risk and reward. By providing this information, advisors can set better expectations with clients and demonstrate alignment with their goals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">For financial advisors, the Risk Number enables them to make informed investment decisions and demonstrate alignment with prospects, clients, and regulators. Clients can see their Risk Number on a scale of 1-99 and understand how much risk they\'re willing to take on to achieve their goals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">Compliance personnel benefit from the Risk Tolerance Questionnaire, which provides a repeatable process for assessing risk tolerance and capacity. This helps ensure that investors are treated as individuals and not stereotyped based on age or other factors.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">Firm executives can leverage the Client Engagement Platform for Wealth Management Firms to equip their teams with the tools needed to assess risk tolerance and capacity. This platform also includes a proposal engine that enables advisors to create personalized proposals that demonstrate their commitment to their clients\' best interests.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">The proposal engine is designed to be easy to use and provides a seamless experience for clients. Advisors can quickly close deals and grow assets under management (AUM) by leveraging the platform\'s features. Clients benefit from seeing how their advisor is acting in their best interests and are more likely to invest fearlessly for the long haul.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">For compliance personnel, the Proposals Dashboard provides a book-of-business view of all clients, reports, and proposals. This allows them to track which clients have received their Risk Number, who has received Form CRS, and where advisors need assistance building proposals.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">Firm executives can roll out a consistent proposal process that both advisors and prospects love, leading to improved close rates and client satisfaction. By leveraging the four most powerful words in the profession &ndash; <em>\"What\'s Your Risk Number?\"</em> &ndash; advisors can quickly capture leads and create ACAT form moments that drive growth.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"mso-fareast-language: EN-IN;\">In conclusion, the Nitrogen is designed to empower advisors and firms to deliver exceptional results by transforming fearful investors into fearless ones.

(92, 7, '<p><strong>JCM Business Solutions: Experts in business development and CRM software solutions</strong></p>', '<p><img class=\"img-responsive magazine-profile-image\" alt=\"\"></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2010, JCM was launched by Chris Moran&mdash;a business consultancy firm, and its design theory was based on one simple maxim: \"Business First, Software Later.\" This is the model that has guided the development of the firm\'s approach to business and CRM software delivery over the years. What started as a small start-up, JCM today is a thriving business known for its Zoho software solutions, embodying greatness in numbers and excellence in delivery through a team of technology-savvy and dedicated consultants.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the years, JCM has grown its services to be the local premium partner of ZOHO, working hand in hand with the company in bringing quality business management software for small businesses. The company\'s partnership with Zoho has therefore enabled JCM to deliver innovative solutions to its clients so as to streamline their operations and to ensure that they are able to meet their objectives.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The success of JCM is due in no small measure to the fact that it is dedicated to the hallowed values enunciated above. The company believes that employees are the most valuable assets it has and provides an environment for growth, learning, and development. This is reflected in the company\'s approach to work-life balance, encouraging flexibility and honesty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The commitment to excellence at JCM is not just limited to internal practices. Consultants at the firm are challenged to look way much above the normal ways of delivering top-of-the-market products and services. It is through such an approach that innovation has developed, bringing positive change within the business. That is also what gave it the ability to keep up with many changing trends and offer customers cutting-edge solutions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is also the issue of the company\'s focus on profitability. To JCM, the company exists to provide jobs and employment opportunities for his colleague, make a reasonable profit from its customers and provide a fair return to its investors. Those who drive and create profit should benefit from it, reflecting the company\'s commitment to fairness and transparency.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Growth and Achievement HISTORY</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Growth and achievements of JCM underline its commitment towards quality. The company has experienced an exceptional growth over the years, and this has helped it to get new premises based on the increased requirement of the human resource and office-space needs. JCM started in a new premise in 2014, and then, later in 2015, it moved into a bigger office space.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2016, the company rebranded with the new motto: \"Business First, Software Later,\" where one understands what clients really need in their business prior to suggesting software solutions. This is what has given JCM an opportunity to build relations with clients and deliver oriented solutions that would meet their unique requirements.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">JCM was awarded Zoho Advanced Partner in 2017, and this can give the company recognition in having the strength in developing Zoho software solutions. Since then, the company has been a crucial part of expanding services to other partnerships, which include Severnside and LRComms, giving full IT support and comprehensive voice solutions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Awards and Recognition</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">JCM has always strived to bring the best together with quality service; hence, it has gained multiple awards and accolades. Last year, the business acquired the Business Heroes Award by the British Chambers of Commerce for what it has done during the lockdown in support of small businesses. That award testifies to the commitment JCM has to empower small businesses to strive in the face of this adversity.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Added to this accolade, JCM is today also recognized as one of the top partners within the UK of Zoho software solutions. The expert handling with Zoho CRM has placed the company as one of the go-to partners for any business wishing a tailored CRM solution.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Future Ahead</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Expect, then, that JCM\'s message will remain the same into the sunset: People first, productivity second, and profitability third. Innovation will remain JCM\'s hallmark in seeking and finding new, improved ways to produce quality products and services.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Supported by a heavyweight consultant and business partner team, JCM is well-situated for continued growth and success with the business community. Business development and CRM software solutions are all available under one roof in JCM.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Chris Moran, Founder/Managing Director</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chris formed JCM in 2010 and now heads up the company\'s Sales and Business Development Teams.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>&ldquo;We believe that the most important part of any business is its people.&rdquo;</strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 'jcm-business-solutions-experts-in-business-development-and-crm-software-solutions', '2022-05-14', 'us/visionaries-network-chris-moran-founder-managing-director-jcm.webp', 14, 'profile', 'JCM Business Solutions: Experts in business development and CRM software solutions', 'JCM Business Solutions', 'JCM Business Solutions', NULL, 1, 'no', 'https://jcmbusinesssolution.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/jcm-business-solutions-llc', 'JCM Business Solutions', '2009', 'Seaford, New York'),

(100, 8, '<p><strong>6 Group is a global search and talent intelligence firm focused on the identification, engagement, and development of the world&rsquo;s standout talent</strong></p>', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a world where satisfying mere requirements can be common practice, 6 Group rejects mediocrity in a bid to be recognized as the genuine alternative. As a facilitator of successful transformation, 6 Group works with its clients to ensure their goals become their own. With operations across EMEAI, Asia Pacific, and the Americas, 6 Group has established itself as a leader in the executive search and leadership development industry.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">6 Group was established 17 years ago by Managing Director James Beazley, a seasoned professional with a wealth of experience in the recruitment and talent acquisition sector. Prior to founding 6 Group, James held a prominent position at Shell, where he served as the Head of Experienced Resourcing for the EMEAR (Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Russia) region.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">During his tenure at Shell, he had the opportunity to collaborate with numerous top-tier search and assessment firms, gaining valuable insights into the industry. However, he soon realized that many of these firms lacked a truly collaborative approach, which often hindered the potential for achieving outstanding results in talent acquisition. This realization became a pivotal moment for James, as he recognized a significant gap in the market for a recruitment service that prioritized genuine collaboration and partnership.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Motivated by his experiences and the desire to create a more effective and client-focused alternative, he took the bold step of founding 6 Group. The company was built on two foundational principles: \"Go Beyond\" and \"Partnering.\" The principle of \"Go Beyond\" reflects 6 Group\'s commitment to exceeding client expectations and delivering exceptional results. This means not only meeting the immediate needs of clients but also anticipating future challenges and opportunities in the talent landscape. By adopting a forward-thinking approach, 6 Group aims to provide solutions that are not just effective but transformative, helping organizations to thrive in an ever-evolving market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The second principle, \"Partnering,\" emphasizes the importance of building strong, collaborative relationships with clients. At 6 Group, the focus is on understanding the unique needs and goals of each organization, fostering a partnership that goes beyond traditional client-vendor dynamics. This collaborative spirit enables 6 Group to tailor its services to align with the specific objectives of its clients, ensuring that the recruitment process is not only efficient but also strategically aligned with the broader vision of the organization.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Through these guiding principles, 6 Group has established itself as a trusted partner in the recruitment industry, dedicated to delivering innovative solutions and exceptional service to its clients. Over the years, the company has grown and evolved, but its core mission remains the same: to provide a real alternative in talent acquisition that prioritizes collaboration, foresight, and partnership.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Today, 6 Group\'s expertise stretches across three core areas: Global Executive Search, Talent Mapping &amp; Pipelining, and Assessment &amp; Development. Its global executive search is about exploring the world\'s standout talent, matching the skills, character, and aspirations of top talent with the specific requirements of its clients\' senior and specialized roles. 6 Group has developed a tried and trusted evidence-based methodology that has led to one of the highest search success rates in the industry (92% search completion vs. the industry average of 64%) and a client re-utilization rate of 100% since 2006.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">6 Group\'s approach is based on an insatiable appetite for discovery, gathering insights into the world\'s top talent through its client solutions. It knows who is in demand, who would be willing to have a conversation, and the remuneration they would expect. Everything it does is underpinned by fact, from exploring a world of senior talent with fresh research and intelligence at hand to presenting its clients with people who have prevailed in an evidence-based assessment process.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Talent mapping and pipelining are about awareness, rendering complete clarity to its clients\' talent market, and utilizing that holistic insight to their advantage. 6 Group builds relationships on behalf of its clients, nurturing strong bonds between them and their talent market so that when they want to engage them, they\'ll be ready to join. It also shapes perceptions by conveying its clients\' employer brand and employee value proposition to the external market, building and communicating a justified narrative of why they are a genuine employer of choice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">6 Group\'s approach is diverse by design, presenting its clients with the truest representation of their talent market possible. Decision-making becomes empowered when diverse companies outperform those that aren\'t - it\'s simply good business practice.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At 6 Group, it has designed a refined concept within its talent mapping &amp; pipelining services that brings its clients\' talent acquisition strategy and execution to a new level. It calls this concept its Capability Engine&trade;. This proprietary attraction strategies &amp; engagement platform promotes access to diverse talent to ensure its clients get the greatest choice of the best talent for them, not just the most available or the people with the right keywords on their CV or LinkedIn profile.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong>&ldquo;Today, we are one of the world&rsquo;s most innovative firms operating across EMEAI, Asia Pacific, and the Americas.&rdquo;</strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', '6-group-global-search-talent-intelligence-firm-identification-engagement-development-of-the-worlds', '2025-03-11', 'us/visionaries-network-6group-james-beazley-md-cover.webp', 1, 'cover', '6 Group is a global search and talent intelligence firm helping businesses identify and develop exceptional leaders worldwide.', 'talent intelligence, executive search, global recruitment, leadership hiring, talent mapping, succession planning, strategic hiring, headhunting, workforce analytics, talent development, recruitment firm, hiring strategy, visionaries network, executive recruitment, top talent', 'Meta title within 60 character, meta keyword 15 words, meta description within 160 character', NULL, 1, 'no', 'https://www.6-group.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/6group/', '6 Group', '2006', 'Altrincham, Cheshire'),

Whether you&rsquo;re saving for a rainy day, planning a dream holiday, or investing in your future, progress begins with small, consistent steps. And Plum is here to make every one of those steps count.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plum is a smart money app built to help people take control of their finances through automation, intelligent saving tools, and secure investment options. It&rsquo;s not just a budgeting app&mdash;it&rsquo;s a financial companion designed to help you build wealth over time, with less effort and more confidence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In a world where personal finance can feel complex or intimidating, Plum brings clarity, simplicity, and even a little humour to the table.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Power of Starting Small</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Many people believe that serious financial progress requires large sums or complicated strategies. But the truth is, meaningful change often starts small&mdash;a few pounds saved here, a minor habit changed there.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That&rsquo;s the idea behind Plum. A single pound invested today can grow into something far bigger tomorrow. And with Plum&rsquo;s automation tools, this happens quietly in the background, without you needing to lift a finger.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From rounding up your purchases to automatically setting aside small amounts based on your spending patterns, Plum helps you form better money habits&mdash;effortlessly.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>From Friendly Bet to Fintech Innovation: The Plum Story</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Back in 2014, two friends from Cyprus&mdash;Victor and Alex&mdash;made a friendly bet: who could save more money? While Victor followed the standard advice (budgeting, transferring money manually to savings), Alex took a different approach. He built an algorithm to do it for him. Unsurprisingly, the algorithm won.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This sparked a bigger idea. Why is managing money still so reliant on willpower and spreadsheets? Why not automate the entire process and make it smarter?</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In 2016, Plum was officially launched to bring this vision to life. Today, Plum serves over 2 million users, with offices in London, Athens, and Nicosia. Voted the Best Personal Finance App in 2023, Plum is continuing its mission to make money management easy, secure, and empowering.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>How Plum Works: Four Simple Steps</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Getting started with Plum is quick and straightforward. In just a few minutes, you can begin your journey toward smarter money habits:</p>\r\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Download the App</strong><br>The Plum app is available for free and easy to set up on iOS or Android.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Connect Your Bank</strong><br>Securely link your bank account so Plum can analyse your income and spending patterns.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Pick Your Money Moves</strong><br>Choose how you want to save or invest&mdash;automate deposits, invest in funds, or stash cash in high-interest &ldquo;Pockets.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l3 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Watch It Grow</strong><br>Track your progress, adjust your goals, and celebrate your milestones along the way.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether you&rsquo;re a complete beginner or already confident with your finances, Plum offers a simple and effective way to take control.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Smart Features That Make a Big Difference</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plum offers a suite of tools that make it more than just a digital piggy bank. These include:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Auto Savers</strong>: Automatically set aside money based on what you can afford.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Round-Ups</strong>: Save your spare change from everyday purchases.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Rainy Day Rule</strong>: Trigger savings when the weather turns gloomy.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>52-Week Challenge</strong>: A proven method to save over &pound;1,000 in a year.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Investment Portfolios</strong>: Choose from a curated selection of funds for long-term growth.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Cash ISA</strong>: Earn up to 4.85% AER (variable) tax-free, and keep your savings growing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These tools are designed to help you form better money habits without thinking about it. Over time, small savings build up, and automated investments put your money to work for the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Cash ISAs: Your Tax-Free Savings Powerhouse</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of Plum&rsquo;s standout products is the <strong>Cash ISA</strong>, which currently offers up to <strong>4.85% AER (variable)</strong> for new customers meeting certain conditions. This includes a 1.56% bonus rate for savings left untouched for 12 months.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You can:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Open a new Cash ISA with just &pound;1.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Transfer an existing ISA to Plum.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l2 level1 lfo3; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Save up to &pound;20,000 each tax year, tax-free.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The FSCS protects eligible deposits up to &pound;85,000 per person, per bank, providing peace of mind that your savings are secure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Investing with Plum: Grow Your Wealth Confidently</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If you&rsquo;re ready to move beyond saving, Plum makes investing accessible with its Stocks &amp; Shares ISA. You can invest up to &pound;20,000 annually into diversified portfolios that suit your risk appetite.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">All investments carry risk, and Plum is clear about this. Market ups and downs mean you could get back less than you invested. But over the long term, investing can offer greater growth potential than keeping cash in a savings account.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plum&rsquo;s approach to investing is transparent and educational, with useful insights to help users make informed decisions without needing to be financial experts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Your Money, Protected and Regulated</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plum may not be a bank, but it follows strict regulations to protect your funds. Depending on the product, your money is held with trusted partners like Citibank, Lloyds Bank, Investec, and BlackRock.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Here&rsquo;s how protection varies:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l1 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Cash ISAs and Easy Access Pockets</strong>: FSCS protected up to &pound;85,000.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l1 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Primary Pockets (E-Money)</strong>: Safeguarded under FCA rules, but not FSCS-protected.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l1 level1 lfo4; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Investments</strong>: Held via Alpaca (SIPC protected up to $500,000 in the U.S.).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Security measures include bank-grade encryption and advanced fraud detection systems. You can rest easy knowing your money is in safe hands.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Brits and Their Funny Relationship With Money</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Let&rsquo;s face it, money can be an awkward topic&mdash;especially in the UK. Research shows that UK households have around &pound;300 billion sitting in non-interest-bearing accounts. That could mean &pound;15 billion lost in interest in just one year!</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Plum believes it&rsquo;s time to take money seriously&mdash;but not too seriously. That&rsquo;s why they teamed up with comedian Mark Simmons to create a joke book that makes personal finance more approachable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From punchlines to Plum Points, this light-hearted approach helps users open up about money and start making better choices.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Plum Stands Out</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unlike traditional banks or other money apps, Plum combines smart automation, humour, and transparent financial tools to create a user-friendly experience. It&rsquo;s not just about saving or investing&mdash;it&rsquo;s about forming sustainable habits that last a lifetime.</p>\r\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0cm;\" type=\"disc\">\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Free to start</strong> with premium features available.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Customisable goals</strong> to match your lifestyle.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Clear risk disclosures</strong> to help you make informed choices.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Award-winning design</strong> and user experience.</li>\r\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo5; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\"><strong>Over 2 million users</strong> and growing fast.<br><br></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"border: none; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\"><strong>Victor Trokoudes, Co-founder &amp; CEO</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"border: none; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\"><em>&ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re at the start of your money journey or consider yourself a pro, Plum&rsquo;s here to help &ndash; from the pennies right up to the pounds.&rdquo;</em><br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just like any other savings provider, except we&rsquo;re not.

The Beacon Group, a Toronto-based management consulting firm, understands this truth at its core. Since its founding, the company has built its entire philosophy around the belief that investing in people is the most powerful way to drive meaningful, sustainable transformation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For over 25 years, Beacon has acted as a steady, guiding force&mdash;like a lighthouse&mdash;helping organizations navigate growth, uncertainty, and change with a clear focus on leadership, culture, and performance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Legacy of Leadership and Vision</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Founded in 1997 by Doug Williamson, The Beacon Group is rooted in over three decades of international experience in leadership and organizational development.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Williamson, who continues to serve as President and CEO, has helped steer executive teams through cultural upheavals, market disruptions, and strategic inflection points. His vision has shaped Beacon into a trusted partner for companies across a range of sectors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By centering their work around leadership effectiveness, organizational culture, and performance optimization, The Beacon Group has become synonymous with transformation grounded in people-centric principles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Lean Team with Big Impact</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Despite their significant impact, The Beacon Group operates as a lean and focused team of approximately 11&ndash;50 professionals. This compact size is deliberate, ensuring agility, responsiveness, and a personalized client experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Key members, such as Linda McKend, the Senior Vice President and CFO, bring operational and strategic rigor, while professionals like Cathy Atkinson lead critical client relationships. This team structure reflects Beacon&rsquo;s values: every client engagement is treated with dedication and depth, never diluted by bureaucracy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Guided by Purpose and Values</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The firm is defined by a clear set of values that drive every engagement. Relationships are at the heart of their work&mdash;clients are partners, not transactions. Their team prides itself on being dependable and quick to respond, enabled by a streamlined structure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Performance is the central metric of success, and their work is designed to unlock the full potential of people within organizations. Above all, Beacon is &ldquo;outcome obsessed&rdquo;&mdash;a trait that ensures strategies are implemented, not just discussed, and that insights lead to tangible, lasting impact.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Comprehensive, People-Centric Solutions</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beacon&rsquo;s service offerings are organized into three interconnected areas: assessments and surveys, leadership training, and facilitation consulting. Their assessments and surveys provide deep, data-driven insights that go well beyond standard templates.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From employee engagement surveys and organizational audits to leadership reviews and DISC assessments, every tool is designed to uncover meaningful data and deliver it in actionable formats. Their services include full lifecycle support&mdash;from design and administration to reporting and confidentiality management&mdash;making them a trusted provider of diagnostics that shape strategy and action.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Building Modern Leaders</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In leadership training, Beacon offers a comprehensive 16-course online curriculum, honed by decades of experience. These courses are structured to build key leadership capabilities&mdash;from decision-making and alignment to talent development and critical thinking. What sets their training apart is its direct connection to the insights gathered during assessments, ensuring that every module targets real, identified gaps in leadership performance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Facilitation that Drives Change</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beacon&rsquo;s facilitation consulting brings another layer of depth to its offerings. Whether leading executive teams through strategic planning sessions or navigating conflict and change, their facilitators offer clarity, structure, and an unbiased perspective. With over 25 years of facilitation experience, they help uncover blind spots, build alignment, and drive thoughtful, future-oriented dialogue across leadership teams.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Proven Four-Phase Model</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The company&rsquo;s consulting approach is guided by a four-phase framework that leads organizations from insight to impact. The journey begins with <strong>Awareness</strong>, where data from surveys, interviews, and diagnostics helps build a clear picture of the current state.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the <strong>Trust phase</strong>, Beacon focuses on fostering psychological safety and shared understanding&mdash;particularly during facilitation. <strong>Alignment</strong> follows, where roles, goals, and responsibilities are clarified. Finally, in the <strong>Growth phase</strong>, organizations scale leadership development and innovation, leveraging agile methods and targeted learning initiatives to build momentum.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Delivering Measurable Results</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beacon&rsquo;s impact is not theoretical&mdash;it is demonstrated through results. From startups to multinational corporations, Beacon&rsquo;s clients span industries and geographies. One notable case involved a Canadian division of a global firm experiencing rapid growth. Beacon provided a tailored mix of diagnostics, leadership development, and facilitation that aligned the organization, improved leadership effectiveness, and increased performance during a critical growth phase.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Research That Shapes the Industry</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Beyond their client work, The Beacon Group also contributes to thought leadership through robust research and white papers. Their landmark study, &ldquo;A Comprehensive Study on Organizational Effectiveness,&rdquo; has been ongoing since 2008 and outlines a five-category framework that includes culture, leadership, strategy, architecture, and balance.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In <em>&ldquo;Deny, Defend, Disrupt,&rdquo; </em>Beacon advocates for experimental, people-first organizations that prioritize learning over control. Another notable piece, &ldquo;Leadership &ndash; Build Towards the Future Now!,&rdquo; quantifies the costs of bureaucracy and encourages bold, proactive leadership.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Why Clients Choose The Beacon Group</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So why choose The Beacon Group over other consultancies? First, they are pragmatic and cost-effective, offering scalable solutions without the complexity and overhead of larger firms. Second, they bring deep, integrated expertise&mdash;offering everything from data analysis and facilitation to training in one seamless package. Third, they value trust and long-term partnerships, prioritizing authentic relationships and sustained support. And finally, they drive real impact&mdash;measured not by the length of their reports, but by the lasting change they help create.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Trusted Partner for the Future</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Beacon Group&rsquo;s commitment to people, outcomes, and transformation has made it a trusted advisor to organizations navigating the future. In a world of rapid change and increasing complexity, they remain a steadfast partner, guiding leaders to unlock the full potential of their people&mdash;and by extension, their organizations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Doug Williamson, President &amp; CEO</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Throughout Doug&rsquo;s more than thirty-five years of international business experience, he has been actively involved in initiating positive, transformational change inside many organizations of diverse sizes, in a range of industries, and in a variety of countries. In the process, he has helped improve the overall performance and effectiveness of countless individual senior leaders and executive teams.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His experience, insight, and expertise have been put to work helping organizations navigate difficult situations arising from structural change, cultural transformation, market disruptions, and/or the need to develop new strategies and new competencies to support sustainable growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Doug is the author of the book&nbsp;Straight Talk on Leadership &ndash; Solving Canada&rsquo;s Business Crisis.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong>&ldquo;Just like the lighthouse, The Beacon Group is here to help guide your organization through the dangers, turbulence, and uncertainty of our current moment.&rdquo;<br><br></strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 'the-beacon-group-guiding-organizational-growth-through-people-first-strategy', '2025-06-17', 'us/visionaries-network-williamson-ceo-the-beacon-group.webp', 2, 'profile', 'The Beacon Group empowers businesses to grow through people-first strategies.

(112, 12, '<p><strong>EV Electra Wins a Spot in the Top Business Leaders Awards 2025 for Redefining Luxury Electric Cars with Sustainability</strong></p>', '<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Electric vehicles (EVs) are a wonderful combination of technology and sustainability that meet the long-awaited need of combating climate change. The transport sector is one of the largest emitters of carbon globally, and a shift towards EVs can significantly reduce our footprint on the planet. Zero tailpipe emissions, along with the benefit of utilizing renewable energy like solar and wind, make EVs an even cleaner environmental option.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">EV Electra, founded by Jihad Mohammad, is transforming the EV industry with its focus on sustainability. With the application of a new hybrid finance model, the company is democratizing EV ownership, with the promise of sustainability being made available to individuals of all income groups and geographies. This mass-based strategy makes the transition to cleaner transport within reach of more individuals.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Besides mere production of automobiles, EV Electra is at the forefront of using AI-powered energy management systems to deliver optimum performance and seamlessly integrate with green infrastructure. EV Electra vehicles complement sources of renewable energy, promoting reduced fossil fuel use. EV Electra\'s move is the embodiment of innovation and sustainability, marking the way forward towards a greener, fairer future of transportation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>A Vision Beyond&nbsp;Cars: Democratizing Sustainability</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">What distinguishes EV Electra is its vision. With Jihad Mohammad at the helm, the company has evolved beyond producing electric vehicles. The objective is to democratize clean mobility and redefine financial access. With the adoption of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in its financial model, EV Electra makes access easier for more people to become part-owners of the company\'s success. This tokenization of equity introduces financial innovation and an open, transparent model of investment&mdash;enabling people to own a part of the transport future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">EV Electra&rsquo;s commitment to sustainability goes beyond electric vehicles; it&rsquo;s about creating a holistic ecosystem that fosters growth, inclusion, and environmental responsibility. As Mohammad states, &ldquo;We are not just building cars&mdash;we&rsquo;re building futures.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the philosophy that&nbsp;drives EV Electra\'s business, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;sustainability&nbsp;not a luxury but&nbsp;the&nbsp;norm&nbsp;for all,&nbsp;so&nbsp;more&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;the green revolution.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Innovation in the Heart of Italy: The Modena Factory</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In May 2025, EV Electra made history in acquiring the iconic \"Blue Factory\" of Bugatti in Modena, Italy&mdash;a move that blends tradition and innovation. Rather than start fresh, the company is reusing this legendary factory to produce its high-performance EV models, building the bridge between the luxury automobile craftsmanship and the future of green technology. The acquisition is the company\'s declaration that luxury can be green and heritage can be reimagined with a view to environmental stewardship.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By giving new life to a symbol of European automotive greatness, EV Electra is showing the world that sustainability is not about discarding the past&mdash;it is about embracing innovation and enriching heritage with modernity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Ensuring a Green Future through Unwavering Financial Backing</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To propel this vision forward, EV Electra secured a $450 million equity line of credit from Silver Rock Group in April 2025. The capital is enabling the company to ramp up production, invest in research and development (R&amp;D), and expand globally. With this strong financial backing, EV Electra will be able to speed up the development of its lineup of electric vehicles and expand its presence in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">But this investment is not just for growth&mdash;there is a bigger plan at work to fuel revolutionary change in the auto and clean energy industries. By prioritizing sustainable innovation in all aspects of its business, EV Electra is making sure that its success is not only profitable but also environmentally sustainable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Leading with Purpose: It\'s More Than a Business</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jihad Mohammad\'s leadership is not just a corporate strategy. He believes that he is a custodian of common prosperity, and he is as committed to social and humanitarian causes as business growth. EV Electra has made investments in humanitarian causes in Palestine, established a growth fund for young entrepreneurs, and created token-based incentives to empower underprivileged communities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This two-pronged business approach demonstrates that EV Electra is a business just as concerned with making money as it is with making a positive impact on society. By injecting these values into the business culture, Mohammad is demonstrating that innovation leadership and sustainability leadership are not merely focused on the bottom line&mdash;it\'s making the world a better place than they began.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>The Road Ahead: Shaping the Future of Mobility</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the objective of importing a worldwide series of vehicles, diversifying its infrastructure, and listing on the stock exchange, EV Electra has only just begun. Its second chapter will be even more groundbreaking because the company continues to innovate and lead the future of eco-mobility and clean technology.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For Jihad Mohammad, the Top Business Leaders Award 2025 is just a stepping stone towards a cleaner, more networked, and more equitable world. EV Electra\'s commitment to innovation and sustainability is more than a business model&mdash;it is a movement, and its future has never looked brighter.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As the world\'s most pressing problems continue to be solved by businesses, EV Electra stands out as a prime example of how sustainability and business can come together to make the world a better, more sustainable place.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 'ev-electra-wins-a-spot-in-the-top-business-leaders-awards-2025', '2025-06-17', 'us/visionaries-network-ev-electra-jihad-mohammad.webp', 3, 'profile', 'EV Electra secures a place in the Top Business Leaders Awards 2025 for its groundbreaking work in redefining luxury electric vehicles with a strong focus on innovation and sustainability.', 'EV Electra, Top Business Leaders Awards 2025, luxury electric cars, sustainable EVs, green mobility, electric vehicle innovation, eco-friendly cars, visionaries network, clean technology, sustainable transportation', 'EV Electra Wins 2025 Business Leaders Award | Luxury EVs with Sustainability', NULL, 1, 'no', 'https://evelectra.com/', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/ev-electra-limited', 'EV Electra ', '2018', 'Lebanon'),

Farmers face constant pressure&mdash;from rising input costs and market volatility to environmental unpredictability. To stay ahead, it&rsquo;s not just about keeping records; it&rsquo;s about extracting value from them. That&rsquo;s where YAGRO comes in. More than just a software company, YAGRO empowers farmers with smart analytics, turning existing farm data into powerful insights. Whether your focus is efficiency, risk reduction, or growth, YAGRO helps you make better, more confident decisions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Smarter Farming Begins with Smarter Data</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Each farm is different. So is each day. Whether you&rsquo;re trying to cut costs, maximize yields, or make expansion decisions, data is key&mdash;but only if you can understand and use it. YAGRO goes beyond farm management software by transforming raw data into clear, actionable intelligence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Designed to work with your current records, YAGRO acts like a personal analyst&mdash;identifying performance trends, comparing costs, and providing real-time decision support. No need to hire a full-time consultant or spend nights digging through spreadsheets. Just plug in your data and let YAGRO do the hard work.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Drive Efficiency with Precision</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">When financial pressure mounts, the first step to stability is efficiency. YAGRO helps identify where you&rsquo;re spending too much&mdash;and where you can get more value. Its Tracker tool gives you clarity on the cost of production, input effectiveness, and budget tracking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Will Oliver of A H Oliver &amp; Son puts it clearly: <em>\"It\'s about growing an efficient crop at the right value, and with Tracker, it\'s so hands-on and easy to access. It means I can continuously monitor our budget at any time.\"</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From seed to sale, YAGRO helps you fine-tune your approach and reduce waste&mdash;without compromising on quality.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Turn Farm Records into Farm Intelligence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Data is only useful if it tells a story. YAGRO&rsquo;s Internal Analytics turns your existing records into meaningful insights&mdash;highlighting which fields, crops, or practices are performing well and which need rethinking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Farmer Jack Smith from A G Wright explains: <em>&ldquo;Reporting to the business owners, they want to know where we are, what we are doing, and where we are heading. Having that information at hand will be all the more important for accurate reporting.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With easy-to-read dashboards and reports, even the most complex data becomes understandable&mdash;and immediately useful.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Grow Your Farm with Confidence</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Growth in farming isn&rsquo;t just about buying more land or planting more acres&mdash;it&rsquo;s about growing wisely. YAGRO allows you to evaluate new crops, practices, or markets using your own data and real-world comparisons.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jamie Key of R W Key shares: <em>&ldquo;By clicking a couple of buttons, the YAGRO platform highlights my opportunities on the farm and collates all my information in a comparable way. This allows me to focus on running my business rather than staring at Excel spreadsheets.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With YAGRO, your decisions are always rooted in real, relevant data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Mitigate Risk Before It Impacts You</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Agricultural risk can&rsquo;t be eliminated&mdash;but it can be managed. YAGRO gives you tools to forecast, prepare, and respond effectively to changing conditions. From underperforming fields to volatile input prices, YAGRO highlights what&rsquo;s controllable and offers strategies to stay ahead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">David South from Thelveton Farms shares: <em>&ldquo;We identified specific fields that were underperforming&hellip; and used cost of production insight to decide whether they were viable for future cropping or better suited to SFI schemes.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That kind of foresight is exactly what keeps farms resilient, even in uncertain times.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Benchmark Against Trusted Peers</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With YAGRO&rsquo;s Virtual Groups, you can compare your performance with verified peers, anonymously and safely. It\'s a way to learn from the best without revealing your hand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Alan Clifton Holt from AA Clifton shares: &ldquo;Getting the right people around the table and having open conversations sparks debates that lead to understanding how others operate&hellip; which in turn adds value to my business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Whether it&rsquo;s cost, yield, or technique, benchmarking helps reveal both strengths and improvement areas.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Your Data. Your Rules.</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In an era where data security is critical, YAGRO prioritizes privacy. Certified as Farm Data Safe, YAGRO ensures that you own your data. Only you decide who sees it and how it&rsquo;s used.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Graham Innes from AP Innes puts it best: &ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t have this information, we&rsquo;d effectively be making blind decisions, risking damaging the long-term viability of the business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With YAGRO, you gain control&mdash;not just over your farm, but over your information too.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Trusted by Farmers Nationwide</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Across the UK, YAGRO is trusted by farms big and small&mdash;from independent growers to multi-generational family businesses. What unites them is the need for reliable, accessible insights.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Duncan Hazard of RM Hazard says: <em>&ldquo;Am flabbergasted at how fantastic this is, bringing all our data in one easy-to-use format. I love this kind of thing&mdash;absolute credit to whoever thought, designed, and got this off the ground.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It&rsquo;s not just software.

It brings together a powerhouse team of senior professionals with decades of experience across finance, technology, academia, and public policy. Their mission is bold yet clear: to help businesses turn complex compliance demands into a competitive advantage through a unique blend of insight, strategy, and implementation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the heart of T3&rsquo;s value proposition is its senior-led, outcome-based delivery model. While many consultancies rely heavily on junior analysts, T3 ensures that every engagement is handled by top-tier professionals&mdash;former COOs, CROs, directors, and regulatory architects who have worked at some of the world&rsquo;s leading institutions. This model not only ensures deep subject-matter expertise but also guarantees that clients receive fast, actionable, and practical results tailored to their business realities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">T3&rsquo;s work is guided by three core principles: Think, Transform, and Thrive. &ldquo;Think&rdquo; is about applying strategic, policy-aligned intelligence to each client\'s unique challenges. &ldquo;Transform&rdquo; focuses on designing and embedding tailored solutions. And &ldquo;Thrive&rdquo; reflects their goal to help clients not just survive disruption, but lead with confidence and resilience in increasingly volatile markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The firm offers a focused suite of services across four interconnected domains: Risk &amp; Regulation, Responsible AI, Sustainability &amp; Climate Change, and Change Management. Each area is led by experts who have directly shaped international policy or led enterprise-wide transformations in these domains.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In <strong>Risk &amp; Regulation</strong>, T3 provides a 360&deg; view across financial and non-financial risks, including operational resilience, governance, compliance, and regulatory engagement. They help organizations align with UK, EU, and global regulatory frameworks such as Basel, FCA/PRA, and EMIR. The goal is not just to meet the letter of the law, but to use regulatory alignment as a way to strengthen strategic direction and stakeholder trust.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">T3 is also a global leader in <strong>Responsible AI</strong>. Their team includes former Google executives who implemented Responsible AI programs at scale, as well as contributors to the EU AI Act, OECD AI Principles, and NIST AI Risk Management Framework. T3 works with clients to develop AI governance strategies, risk management systems, training, and implementation support that ensures compliance and accountability&mdash;especially as AI regulations evolve rapidly across regions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the <strong>Sustainability and Climate</strong> practice, T3 supports businesses in navigating the complex landscape of ESG reporting, green claims, and regulatory disclosures. Their services include alignment with ISSB, CSRD, SFDR, GRI, and EU taxonomy, as well as climate risk assessments and ESG strategy development. In an era where greenwashing risks are high&mdash;over 40% of green claims in Europe were found to be misleading&mdash;T3 helps organizations build credibility and structure around their sustainability messaging and data.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Their <strong>Change Management</strong> offering complements these services by ensuring that transformations&mdash;whether regulatory, technological, or strategic&mdash;are sustainable and embedded. Using proven frameworks, they manage stakeholder alignment, risk mitigation, governance structures, and culture change. Whether it&rsquo;s navigating an AI adoption journey or implementing new ESG disclosures across business units, T3 ensures organizations are equipped for both immediate transition and long-term success.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">T3&rsquo;s impact is not just theoretical. Their leadership and teams have worked with over 25 banks and financial services firms in the past year alone. They have trained over 20 governments in risk management, won four major awards in the risk and AI space, and have had a 100% contribution rate to the development of new international standards. They&rsquo;ve also helped clients avoid reputational and regulatory fallout by auditing and correcting misleading ESG claims and implementing Responsible AI frameworks that passed internal and regulatory scrutiny.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Among T3&rsquo;s key differentiators is their collaborative model. The firm maintains a robust network of partnerships with technology vendors, research organizations, think tanks, and advocacy groups. This allows them to provide clients with not only best-in-class advisory, but also access to innovative tools, data platforms, and implementation support. Their work is scalable, practical, and always tailored to the client\'s maturity, sector, and ambition.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">T3 serves a wide array of sectors including banking, fintech, asset management, commodities, tech, aerospace, telecom, life sciences, and manufacturing. Each engagement is adapted to the regulatory environment and operational complexity of the sector, ensuring relevance and depth. Clients value T3 not just for their technical skills but for their ability to deliver fast, clear, and confident outcomes in high-stakes contexts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Recognition for T3&rsquo;s impact continues to grow. Co-founder Jen Gennai was recently shortlisted for &ldquo;AI Leader of the Year&rdquo; and included in the &ldquo;Top 33 Women Shaping Responsible AI.&rdquo; T3 was also featured as a finalist for the &ldquo;AI for Good&rdquo; award and highlighted by British-American Business in their Transatlantic Growth Tracker. These accolades underscore the firm&rsquo;s growing influence on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At its core, T3 Consultants is more than a risk and regulation firm. It&rsquo;s a strategic ally for forward-thinking businesses who want to navigate complexity with clarity, embed transformation with integrity, and lead markets with purpose. For organizations that see regulation not as a burden but as a chance to lead, T3 is the trusted partner that ensures you don&rsquo;t just adapt&mdash;you thrive.<br><br><strong>Lana H.</strong>, <strong>Partner &ndash; Risk &amp; RegTech</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"border: none; mso-border-alt: solid windowtext .5pt; padding: 0cm; mso-padding-alt: 1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt;\">Lana H. helps organizations tackle last-minute compliance challenges while developing forward-looking regulatory strategies. At T3 Consultants, she plays a key role in bridging the gap between urgent regulatory demands&mdash;such as FCA oversight, operational resilience, the AI Act, and ESG mandates&mdash;and long-term business sustainability. Her focus is on turning compliance into a strategic advantage for clients.</p>\r\n<h4 style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"><strong>&ldquo;We translate complex ESG regulations (EU Taxonomy, CSRD, SFDR, CSDDD) into actionable strategies.&rdquo;<br></strong></h4>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>', 'VisionariesNetwork Team', 't3-consultants-transforming-risk-esg-and-ai-into-opportunity', '2025-06-17', 'us/visionaries-network-t3-consultants-lana-h.webp', 9, 'profile', 'T3 Consultants help businesses navigate risk, ESG, and AI challengesâ€”turning them into growth opportunities with expert insights and data-driven strategies.', 'risk management, ESG strategy, AI consulting, T3 Consultants, sustainable business, enterprise risk, visionaries network, data-driven consulting, corporate governance', 'T3 Consultants &ndash; Turning Risk, ESG, and AI into Strategic Advantage', NULL, 1, 'no', 'https://t3-consultants.com/ ', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/t3-consultants/ ', 'T3 Consultants', ' 2023', 'Headquarters  London, GB');
